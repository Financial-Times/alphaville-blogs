Revenues came in at &#xA3;10.4bn, split UK &#xA3;6.47 bn, Nordics &#xA3;3.5 bn and Greece at &#xA3;459 mn. Group LFL sales grew by +1% in FY19 split UK electricals +1%, UK mobile -4%, Nordics +3% and Greece +13%. Dixons Carphone has also announced a final dividend of 4.5p (full year 6.75p) and has a net debt position of &#xA3;265 mn.<br>\nGuidance:<br>\nFY20E: DC expects headline PBT of c.&#xA3;210m, Capex of &#xA3;275m (inline with previous guidance) with net debt broadly flat year-on-year and plans to maintain full year dividend. UK mobile is expected to be significantly loss making in FY20E and will incur exceptional cash cost of c.&#xA3;80m.<br>\n5 year transformation plan: DC expects EBIT margin improvement to at least 3.5% by FY23 (a year earlier than planned), gross savings of &#xA3;200m (delivered two years earlier by FY22) and PBT of over &#xA3;300m by F22E (GSe &#xA3;288m).<br>\nWhat does it all mean? Other things equal, we expect Reuters PBT consensus for FY20E to decline by c.30% to &#xA3;210m (-30% yoy) reflecting DC&#x2019;s update guidance.<br>\nValuation: Our 12-month price target of 148p is based on a DCF. We are Neutral rated.<br>\nKey risks: (-) Further slowdown in the UK demand environment is a key near/mid-term risk, (+) innovative product cycle. (-) Key structural risks: increased pure-play competition in electricals; relationships with MNOs and risk of disintermediation in UK mobile; higher penetration of SIM-only/SIM-free phones; changes in consumer preference.</p></blockquote>\n</div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">Tom

The company selling down its shareholdings in Delivery Hero, HelloFresh, Home24 and Westwing (followed by a successful IPO of Jumia) has also raised questions in regards to next steps in the company&#x2019;s strategy.<br>\n&#xF0B7; While a buyback would probably be a sensible move in terms of value generation, we question the funding potential. Rocket&#x2019;s share price is down 30% since the company&#x2019;s IPO and investors are, in our view, unlikely to accept a premium of less than 30%, leading to a potential market cap of greater than &#x20AC;5bn at acquisition. With CEO Oliver Samwer owning c44% (through Global Founders/other holdings), such a move would absorb almost all of Rocket&#x2019;s current net cash balance (&#x20AC;3.1bn as of Q119) with limited firepower for additional acquisitions/new launches &#x2013; we would be surprised at such a move.</p></blockquote>\n</div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">wayneJ</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBCA asset backed loan book grew to &#xA3;148.4M last year (p18 AR)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">Mouselet</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI suppose Imperial Innovations is a bit too early-stage and RCP a bit too late-stage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1561027365\" data-mid=\"1447993\" data-rawmessage=\"Rocket up 7.1% live.\" id=\"webchat-msg-1447993\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">11:42am</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>Rocket up 7.1% live.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1561027386\" data-mid=\"1447994\" data-rawmessage=\"Which I guess leads us into Delivery Hero.\" id=\"webchat-msg-1447994\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">11:43am</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>Which I guess leads us into Delivery Hero.</p>\n</div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">Pharma</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t@BE, wouldn&apos;t &quot;E1.5bn or so of unlisted investments that are being valued at nothing&quot; be more accurately be described as &quot;&#x20AC;zero worth of investments being valued by the company at &#x20AC;1.5Bn&quot;?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">wayneJ</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t@Mouselet - Imperial Innovations changed its name to Touchstone and was acquired by IP Group....\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">Bluesky21</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t@Mouselet - agree it&apos;s too early-stage anyway\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><time class=\"marketslive-timestamp o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2019-06-20T10:43:39.000Z\" title=\"Thu Jun 20 2019 10:43:39 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Thu Jun 20 2019 10:43:39 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t11:43 am\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1561027434\" data-mid=\"1447995\" data-rawmessage=\"(@Pharma: well, precisely.)\" id=\"webchat-msg-1447995\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">11:43am</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>(@Pharma: well, precisely.)</p>\n</div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">wayneJ</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWeBuyAnyCar makes an EBITDA of &#xA3;105 per car (note that this might be due to transfer pricing to another division)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1561027466\" data-mid=\"1447996\" data-rawmessage=\"More revenue growth!
