In other words, the moves to the downside are<br>\nbeing cushioned; arguably this is a direct outcome of the improved balance sheets<br>\nof the mining companies and/or higher margins. In the recent market sell-off in Q4<br>\n2018 the miners fell only slightly more than the market. We think this theme can<br>\ncontinue to play out in 2019 despite the miners being very sensitive to macro growth<br>\n- the Enterprise Value has now been accruing to shareholders (debt to equity) which<br>\nis expected to lift the floor of the mining companies and reduce investor risk.<br>\nFurthermore beta has moved down significantly in the past year. One of our key<br>\nviews for the mining sector is that we expect that the beta of the mining companies<br>\nto move down, thereby reducing the WACC of the mining companies and potentially<br>\nresult in a sector re-rating.</p></blockquote>\n</div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">hornblower</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tanyone know why DEBS price imploding now (other than obvious reasons)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1546860782\" data-mid=\"1433488\" data-rawmessage=\"None of which explains Fres specifically, because I can&apos;t.
