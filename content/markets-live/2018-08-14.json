On a<br>\nfive-year view, assuming the deal does not complete, we expect the unique, 30%+ EBIT margin hectorite clays in Elementis&#x2019;s legacy business to increase personal care&#x2019;s contribution to EBIT from 38% to 43%. This is clearly inconsistent with a valuation at a 17% discount to two-year averages, and 7% to the industrials-dominated SX4p. The higher multiples associated with the earnings shift could drive a blue-sky scenario with c50% upside.</p></blockquote>\n</div></div><div class=\"msg separator has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1534241936\" data-mid=\"1425014\" data-rawmessage=\"11:18AM\" id=\"webchat-msg-1425014\">\n\t<div class=\"messagebody\"><time class=\"o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2018-08-14T10:18:56.000Z\" title=\"Tue Aug 14 2018 10:18:56 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Tue Aug 14 2018 10:18:56 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tundefined\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time></div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">Soundbuy</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCheers for that..........Croda a tad over valued perhaps......\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">cheeckychappy</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t@BE - how about some dinner party live?
