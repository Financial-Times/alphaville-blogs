If Ligado, the 5G project in the US that pays USD125m pa for ISAT&#x2019;s spectrum, was to consider a suspension of its payments to Inmarsat, we believe Inmarsat would have no other option than to drastically cut the cash dividend (we currently assume stabilityfor the coming years).We would also consider cutting our TP by 100p per share in this scenario. Considering all these risks, we maintain our Hold rating. An update is expected on 9 March (FY17 release).</p></blockquote>\n</div></div><time class=\"marketslive-timestamp o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2018-02-13T11:27:51.000Z\" title=\"Tue Feb 13 2018 11:27:51 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Tue Feb 13 2018 11:27:51 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t11:27 am\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1518521286\" data-mid=\"1409773\" data-rawmessage=\"HSBC notes in passing the old Inmarsat bid theory as a support, citing the FT from back in June.\" id=\"webchat-msg-1409773\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">11:28am</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>HSBC notes in passing the old Inmarsat bid theory as a support, citing the FT from back in June.</p>\n</div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">rwl</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t@pancakes - maybe one day we will also see FTAV there - (or in room 101) !\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1518521312\" data-mid=\"1409774\" data-rawmessage=\"Fairly sure that was a fantasy M&amp;A thing from RBC about how Inmarsat and Dish would go well together.\" id=\"webchat-msg-1409774\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">11:28am</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>Fairly sure that was a fantasy M&amp;A thing from RBC about how Inmarsat and Dish would go well together.</p>\n</div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">Pseudonym</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHow is the USD so low against the GBP, when the UK has decided to beat it&apos;s economy repeatedly with a big stick?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">erlkin</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tis elliot wave still plausible?........&#x201C;The current period of stability has overtaken 1965, and only once since 1920-1995 has the market enjoyed a longer run without a 5 percent fall,&#x201D; he wrote in the commentary.&#x201C;While the fifth wave can last for weeks, months or even years, it inevitably precludes a significant market correction, on average giving up between 38 percent and 50 percent of all gains.&#x201D;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">Swedish Chef</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThese days thanks to BT we all have super fast fibre connections, former employees, footballers and shareholders are all richly rewarded by a well audited business.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">Miss Piggy</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t#DigbyJones: @BE, (keeping it legal), Digby has that whole buinessman demeanor down to a tee, the Midlands gruff impatience manner.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">BornCynic</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t@pancakes / rwl - I went to the Science Museum a couple of years ago and was amused to see my mothers model of mobile phone in one of the exhibition cases.......\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1518521348\" data-mid=\"1409775\" data-rawmessage=\"Which is, as I say, just fantasy M&amp;A.
