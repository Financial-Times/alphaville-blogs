Furthermore, we believe HL has done the right thing in passing its fees while the fund remains closed, as well as asking Woodford to suspend its own fees on its clients&apos; behalf. The Wealth lists are constructed on a long-term biased regimented methodology that is designed to help their clients with investment decisions. We expect HL to be impacted by c.&#xA3;0.40-0.45m per month while Woodford remains closed, so the financial impact is expected to be minimal in a group context. We believe HL is a structural growth story for potentially decades to come. We believe HL offers the ideal combination of rapid growth combined with a high operating margin, exceptional customer persistency, high cash conversion, low capital utilisation, low earnings risk and it holds a dominant market position.</p></blockquote>\n</div></div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1560250767\" data-mid=\"1447254\" data-rawmessage=\"That was out mid yesterday.\" id=\"webchat-msg-1447254\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">11:59am</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>That was out mid yesterday.</p>\n</div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">cracklenpop</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t@1966I&apos;m sure John McDonnell is looking at Woodford&apos;s imposition of capital controls with some  interest....\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><time class=\"marketslive-timestamp o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2019-06-11T10:59:31.000Z\" title=\"Tue Jun 11 2019 10:59:31 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Tue Jun 11 2019 10:59:31 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t11:59 am\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time><div class=\"msg separator has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1560250786\" data-mid=\"1447255\" data-rawmessage=\"11:59AM\" id=\"webchat-msg-1447255\">\n\t<div class=\"messagebody\"><time class=\"o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2019-06-11T10:59:46.000Z\" title=\"Tue Jun 11 2019 10:59:46 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Tue Jun 11 2019 10:59:46 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tundefined\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time></div></div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1560250826\" data-mid=\"1447256\" data-rawmessage=\"Okay, going to knock off on time today because I have to write a story about ............... wait let me check ..............\" id=\"webchat-msg-1447256\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">12:00pm</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>Okay, going to knock off on time today because I have to write a story about ............... wait let me check ..............</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1560250834\" data-mid=\"1447257\" data-rawmessage=\"......................
