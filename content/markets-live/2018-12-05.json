We take the probability of an orderly negotiated Brexit down from 60% to 50%. And we push the possibility of &#x201C;no Brexit&#x201D; up from 20% to 40%. Taken together, that means a 60-40 call on Brexit occurring in the first half of 2019, as opposed to 80-20 previously. Within the &#x201C;no Brexit&#x201D; scenarios, a unilateral revocation on the UK&#x2019;s part looks more likely to us than a  joint UK-EU decision to extend the Article 50 negotiating period and thereby keep the existing clock running. And a  second referendum strikes us  as  rather more  likely than a  general election to  be driving a decision to revoke. Hence, within that 40% &#x201C;no  Brexit&#x201D; possibility, we  see a 25% chance  of  a revocation to facilitate a second referendum, and a 15% chance that it is to facilitate a general election.</p></blockquote>\n</div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">Pharma</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNo Brexit means a Corbyn government at some point, as the tories will loose over half their core support.
