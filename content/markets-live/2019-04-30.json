Indicative<br>\ntiming is drawdowns of US$1,000m, US$1,000m and US$500m in<br>\n2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively. For each US$500m drawn from the<br>\nRCF, a senior secured HY bond will be issued. (The HY issuance will<br>\nnot necessarily be issued at the same terms as the initial HY bond).<br>\nAdditionally, each US$500m drawn will release US$200m in additional<br>\nRCF liquidity (e.g. US$1,000m of additional RCF liquidity once<br>\nUS$2,500m of HY bonds issued). Conditional on: (i) successful equity<br>\nraise, (ii) net US$400m from CB issuance, (iii) US$500m HY bond<br>\nissuance, and (iv) satisfaction of CPs.</p></blockquote>\n</div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">GBKrona</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthanks @BE, ROTR\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">Tom Dalgleish</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t70 comments\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">Soundbuy</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t71\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1556622321\" data-mid=\"1443271\" data-rawmessage=\"Neil&apos;s story&apos;s here: https://www.ft.com/content/be2362ca-6b13-11e9-80c7-60ee53e6681d\" id=\"webchat-msg-1443271\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">12:05pm</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>Neil&apos;s story&apos;s here: <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/be2362ca-6b13-11e9-80c7-60ee53e6681d\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.ft.com...-80c7-60ee53e6681d</a></p>\n</div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">Soundbuy</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCheers all\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><time class=\"marketslive-timestamp o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2019-04-30T11:05:16.000Z\" title=\"Tue Apr 30 2019 11:05:16 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Tue Apr 30 2019 11:05:16 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t12:05 pm\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time><div class=\"msg separator has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1556622331\" data-mid=\"1443272\" data-rawmessage=\"12:05PM\" id=\"webchat-msg-1443272\">\n\t<div class=\"messagebody\"><time class=\"o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2019-04-30T11:05:31.000Z\" title=\"Tue Apr 30 2019 11:05:31 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Tue Apr 30 2019 11:05:31 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tundefined\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time></div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">GBKrona</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t72\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">Tom Dalgleish</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWhats to talk about\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">Tom Dalgleish</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDo expunged comments count\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">VV75</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnothing on Standard Chartered?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">BornCynic</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThanks BE / ROTR\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">GBKrona</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI meant 73 -
