Peel Hunt was recently made aware, during the preparation of the Company&apos;s annual report, that the Payments had been made in December 2018 and has advised the Company that they constituted related party transactions that required notification at the time under Rule 13 of the AIM Rules for Companies. The Directors (other than Lord Drayson and Lorrie Headley) considered the Payments to be appropriate and remain of that view.  Peel Hunt cannot advise as to whether the Payments were fair and reasonable.<br>\nThe Company intends to consult with its major institutional shareholders on the Payments and its remuneration policy following the publication of its annual report on 7 October 2019.</p></blockquote>\n</div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">Kiwi-juice</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNorges Bank statement (Hikvision owner): &#x201C;Respect for human rights is a natural part of good business practice and risk management.&#x201D; Still holders\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">npf1</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBE: Anything on Phillips NV and or Seimens Healthineers please.
