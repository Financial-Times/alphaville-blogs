The risk to this scenario, however, (for us) is a growing feeling that Imperial may announce another investment year behind reduced risk (specifically heated tobacco). Our personal view of such a move, and those of a number of investors we have spoken to, would be negative. In addition to the earnings downgrades, we also believe we would see de-rating. We believe there would be both little confidence in the end result of such investment and the lack of visibility on model delivery persists. From conversations we have had with the company post the release, and commentary around just investing further behind Blu in the coming year, we do not see another &quot;investment year&quot; scenario playing out (a positive) and as such, would expect outperformance over the near-term to persist.</p></blockquote>\n</div></div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1506594248\"

We would anticipate that the business will try and re-negotiate covenant criteria on a permanent basis when the company formalises a restructuring plan.</p></blockquote>\n</div></div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1506596035\" data-mid=\"1394192\" data-rawmessage=\"...... so, we await the rescue plan.
