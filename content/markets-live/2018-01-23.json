We believe structural change will continue to drive bifurcation in growth and valuation. In this note, we address five key debates to watch in 2018 and beyond:<br>\n1) Will ad spend decouple further from the macro after the 2017 inflection?<br>\n2) Will ad dollars shift more aggressively from TV to online?<br>\n3) Will fee pressure and disintermediation intensify for Agencies &#x2013; and is 2018 the year of the margin reset?<br>\n4) Media/telecom convergence &#x2013; what&#x2019;s next?<br>\n5) Is large-scale M&amp;A back on the table?<br>\nAs most of these questions call for nuanced answers with a range of timing and differing degrees of impact, we see greater alpha potential picking stocks within subsectors rather than the subsectors &#x2013; even more so this year as returns dispersions have reached all-time lows. We prefer stocks with specific narratives (self-help; portfolio reorganisation; market repair) that can demonstrate an improving growth and returns profile.</p></blockquote>\n</div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">Blank canvas</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthanks for everything today\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">SoS</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI was looking at IG results: &quot;IG exists to empower informed, decisive, adventurous people to access opportunities in financial markets. &quot;oh dear oh dear\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1516709087\" data-mid=\"1407512\" data-rawmessage=\"NOTE TO SELLSIDE RESEARCH EDITORS: learn what a dangling modifier is.\" id=\"webchat-msg-1407512\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">12:04pm</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>NOTE TO SELLSIDE RESEARCH EDITORS: learn what a dangling modifier is.</p>\n</div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">FATDAZ</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t@Pharma indeed all a question of context\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">Soundbuy</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNo ITE Grp there............\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1516709109\" data-mid=\"1407513\" data-rawmessage=\"The first line of that suggests that Goldman Sachs had a tumultuous 2017 marked by earnings disappointments and contracting multiples.\" id=\"webchat-msg-1407513\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">12:05pm</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>The first line of that suggests that Goldman Sachs had a tumultuous 2017 marked by earnings disappointments and contracting multiples.</p>\n</div></div><time class=\"marketslive-timestamp o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2018-01-23T12:05:10.000Z\" title=\"Tue Jan 23 2018 12:05:10 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Tue Jan 23 2018 12:05:10 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t12:05 pm\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1516709125\" data-mid=\"1407514\" data-rawmessage=\"Which would be accurate, but it&apos;s not the point your analysts are trying to make.\" id=\"webchat-msg-1407514\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">12:05pm</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>Which would be accurate, but it&apos;s not the point your analysts are trying to make.</p>\n</div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">FATDAZ</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI love netflix   but see that their  projected cash burn this year is US$4 billion  ouch\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1516709164\" data-mid=\"1407515\" data-rawmessage=\"So anyway, buy EM and US ......\" id=\"webchat-msg-1407515\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">12:06pm</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>So anyway, buy EM and US ......</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1516709176\" data-mid=\"1407516\" data-rawmessage=\"Beased on the house view:\" id=\"webchat-msg-1407516\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">12:06pm</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>Beased on the house view:</p>\n</div></div><time class=\"marketslive-timestamp o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2018-01-23T12:06:22.000Z\" title=\"Tue Jan 23 2018 12:06:22 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Tue Jan 23 2018 12:06:22 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t12:06 pm\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time><div class=\"msg blockquote has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1516709197\" data-mid=\"1407517\" data-rawmessage=\"Overall, our Economists expect global GDP growth to remain strong in 2018 at 4.1%, above consensus at 3.6% and an improvement from 3.8% in 2017.
