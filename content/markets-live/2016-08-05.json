We do not expect tightening in eligible &#xA3; IG bonds on a similar scale, because 1) the starting point for spreads is tighter, 2) the external backdrop is different, 3) the size of BoE buying may well end up smaller than the &#xA3;10bn, 4) if the eligible universe is &#xA3;150bn, then the proportion the BoE will buy is smaller than the ECB, which at the current run rate will hold more than 10% of eligible bonds by the end of the existing programme in March of next year. However, we still expect that the ultimate reaction will be considerably larger than the initial reaction and would target 25-30bp of tightening in eligible bonds from before the announcement. As such, at current spreads we would add in eligible bonds where possible.</p></blockquote>\n</div></div>\n\n<div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1470391604\" data-mid=\"1339769\" data-rawmessage=\"And then there&apos;s all the NIM stuff affecting the banks\" id=\"webchat-msg-1339769\"><span class=\"messageheader par color-1\" title=\"11:06\">PM</span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>And then there&apos;s all the NIM stuff affecting the banks</p>\n</div></div>\n\n<div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1470391611\" data-mid=\"1339770\" data-rawmessage=\"And this new TFS thingy\" id=\"webchat-msg-1339770\"><span class=\"messageheader par color-1\" title=\"11:06\">PM</span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>And this new TFS thingy</p>\n</div></div>\n\n<time class=\"marketslive-timestamp o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2016-08-05T10:06:56.000Z\" title=\"Fri Aug 05 2016 10:06:56 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Fri Aug 05 2016 10:06:56 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t11:06 am\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1470391631\" data-mid=\"1339771\" data-rawmessage=\"Here&apos;s Fiona Simpson at Morgan Stanley\" id=\"webchat-msg-1339771\"><span class=\"messageheader par color-1\" title=\"11:07\">PM</span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>Here&apos;s Fiona Simpson at Morgan Stanley</p>\n</div></div>\n\n<div class=\"msg blockquote has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1470391645\" data-mid=\"1339772\" data-rawmessage=\"We expect limited take up of the Term Funding Scheme (TFS) beyond\nrolling Funding forLending Scheme (FLS) balances although the policy\ndoes help highlight the Bank of England&apos;s concern on the health of banks and\nensuring transmission of monetary policy.

Acquisitions in 1H16 have soaked up c&#xA3;100m of<br>\ncash, with a further &#xA3;60m absorbed by the share buyback (now suspended due<br>\nto merger talks), with net debt /EBITDA now at 1.7x.<br>\nManagement has announced &#x2013; but not quantified &#x2013; a new cost savings<br>\nprogramme which will probably be discussed at the analyst meeting at 0900<br>\nUKT. We suspect other questions will search for insight into the potential<br>\nRank/888 (NR) deal, as management has issued no comments on this in the<br>\nresults statement.

They don&#x2019;t seem to have responded to this message.\no   On 30 June Nortek contacted Strategic C to determine if they were interested in a transaction, but were told they weren&#x2019;t.

While negotiations with Strategic B seems to have gone nowhere, discussions with Strategic C seem to have been more meaningful, but ultimately they pulled out of an offer for the whole at the same time as UTC, but indicated they remained interested in parts of Nortek.  Of the financial bidders, only one Financial C submitted an offer at $70-$70 per share but this wasn&#x2019;t pursued.<br>\n&#xB7;        UTC came back in December last year to propose an acquisition of parts of Nortek and this lead to serious discussions in January of this year.  However, by late January the Nortek board decided that it wouldn&#x2019;t pursue this.<br>\n&#xB7;        Interestingly, on 1 June, Nortek got back in touch with UTC to determine if it was interested in buying the whole of Nortek, or if it was still only interested in parts of Nortek.  UTC&#x2019;s response was that they were not interested in the whole &#x2013; just the CAS and residential HVAC businesses.<br>\n&#xB7;        While Nortek were concluding their deal with Melrose during June, they were also speaking with other bidders to determine if there was a superior offer available:<br>\no   On 12 June Michael Clarke &#x2013; Nortek CEO &#x2013; informed the Nortek board that he had spoken to Financial A and Financial C from last year&#x2019;s sale process and they were apparently still interested in a transaction.  The Nortek board granted them access to the data room to conduct due diligence, but a week later (22 June) both bidders said they were not interested.<br>\no   On 14 June Ares (the debt fund that is a major shareholder) received an unsolicited call from another financial bidder &#x2013; Financial E &#x2013; and the Nortek board then granted them access to the data room for due diligence. They ultimately put forward an offer of $70-$75 per share on 25 June (this is presumably the level at which a leveraged deal stacks up), but were told that it needed to be in the &#x201C;80s&#x201D; to be competitive.  They don&#x2019;t seem to have responded to this message.<br>\no   On 30 June Nortek contacted Strategic C to determine if they were interested in a transaction, but were told they weren&#x2019;t.  There was also a Chinese financial bidder, but they weren&#x2019;t seen as credible.<br>\n&#xB7;        Finally, last Friday (1 July), Nortek again contact UTC to determine if they were interested in doing a deal.  UTC told them on Monday that they were still only interested in select businesses, not the whole.</p></blockquote>\n</div></div>\n\n<div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1470394617\" data-mid=\"1339919\" data-rawmessage=\"From the 14D9 thing\" id=\"webchat-msg-1339919\"><span class=\"messageheader par color-1\" title=\"11:56\">PM</span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>From the 14D9 thing</p>\n</div></div>\n\n<div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1470394644\" data-mid=\"1339920\" data-rawmessage=\"okay, so Melrose is up 70% post announcing the purchase, having been nearly a cash shell before that.\" id=\"webchat-msg-1339920\"><span class=\"messageheader par color-2\" title=\"11:57\">BE</span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>okay, so Melrose is up 70% post announcing the purchase, having been nearly a cash shell before that.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n<time class=\"marketslive-timestamp o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2016-08-05T10:57:19.000Z\" title=\"Fri Aug 05 2016 10:57:19 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Fri Aug 05 2016 10:57:19 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t11:57 am\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1470394654\" data-mid=\"1339921\" data-rawmessage=\"Purchase price of &#xA3;2.2bn, EV.\" id=\"webchat-msg-1339921\"><span class=\"messageheader par color-2\" title=\"11:57\">BE</span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>Purchase price of &#xA3;2.2bn, EV.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n<div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1470394707\" data-mid=\"1339922\" data-rawmessage=\"Assuming the 70% accretion is justified, somehow, can&apos;t Melrose just sell the business immediately on completion for about &#xA3;3.7bn?\" id=\"webchat-msg-1339922\"><span class=\"messageheader par color-2\" title=\"11:58\">BE</span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>Assuming the 70% accretion is justified, somehow, can&apos;t Melrose just sell the business immediately on completion for about &#xA3;3.7bn?</p>\n</div></div>\n\n<div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1470394724\" data-mid=\"1339923\" data-rawmessage=\"hehehe -- maybe\" id=\"webchat-msg-1339923\"><span class=\"messageheader par color-1\" title=\"11:58\">PM</span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>hehehe -- maybe</p>\n</div></div>\n\n<time class=\"marketslive-timestamp o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2016-08-05T10:58:50.000Z\" title=\"Fri Aug 05 2016 10:58:50 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Fri Aug 05 2016 10:58:50 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t11:58 am\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1470394745\" data-mid=\"1339924\" data-rawmessage=\"Instant &#xA3;1.5bn return and management doesn&apos;t even need to get out of bed.\" id=\"webchat-msg-1339924\"><span class=\"messageheader par color-2\" title=\"11:59\">BE</span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>Instant &#xA3;1.5bn return and management doesn&apos;t even need to get out of bed.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n<div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1470394754\" data-mid=\"1339925\" data-rawmessage=\"It&apos;s a brilliant model this.
