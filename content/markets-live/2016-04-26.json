It is rated at 19.7x our FY16 forecasts declining to 16.1x in the following year. We continue to prefer United Carpets (UCP &#x2013; BUY -17.5p) and Victoria Carpets (VCP &#x2013; BUY &#x2013; 1,750p).</p></blockquote>\n</div></div>\n\n<div class=\"msg separator has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1461667524\" data-mid=\"1324976\" data-rawmessage=\"11:45AM\" id=\"webchat-msg-1324976\"><div class=\"messagebody\"><time class=\"o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2016-04-26T10:45:24.000Z\" title=\"Tue Apr 26 2016 10:45:24 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Tue Apr 26 2016 10:45:24 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tundefined\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time></div></div>\n\n<time class=\"marketslive-timestamp o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2016-04-26T10:46:06.000Z\" title=\"Tue Apr 26 2016 10:46:06 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Tue Apr 26 2016 10:46:06 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t11:46 am\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1461667581\" data-mid=\"1324977\" data-rawmessage=\"You can read about Allied Minds here:  http://www.investegate.co.uk/allied-minds--alm-/rns/allied-minds-raises--80m-for-abls-capital/201604260700072802W/\" id=\"webchat-msg-1324977\"><span class=\"messageheader par color-1\" title=\"11:46\">PM</span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>You can read about Allied Minds here:  <a href=\"http://www.investegate.co.uk/allied-minds--alm-/rns/allied-minds-raises--80m-for-abls-capital/201604260700072802W/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.investe...1604260700072802W/</a></p>\n</div></div>\n\n<div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1461667594\" data-mid=\"1324978\" data-rawmessage=\"This is the drug exploration unit they run with Bristol Myers\" id=\"webchat-msg-1324978\"><span class=\"messageheader par color-1\" title=\"11:46\">PM</span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>This is the drug exploration unit they run with Bristol Myers</p>\n</div></div>\n\n<div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1461667600\" data-mid=\"1324979\" data-rawmessage=\"getting loads of fresh funding\" id=\"webchat-msg-1324979\"><span class=\"messageheader par color-1\" title=\"11:46\">PM</span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>getting loads of fresh funding</p>\n</div></div>\n\n<time class=\"marketslive-timestamp o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2016-04-26T10:46:42.000Z\" title=\"Tue Apr 26 2016 10:46:42 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Tue Apr 26 2016 10:46:42 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t11:46 am\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1461667617\" data-mid=\"1324980\" data-rawmessage=\"Still waiting for Credit Suisse to come out with something on AM\" id=\"webchat-msg-1324980\"><span class=\"messageheader par color-1\" title=\"11:46\">PM</span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>Still waiting for Credit Suisse to come out with something on AM</p>\n</div></div>\n\n<div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1461667628\" data-mid=\"1324981\" data-rawmessage=\"In the meantime, here&apos;s a snap from Numis\" id=\"webchat-msg-1324981\"><span class=\"messageheader par color-1\" title=\"11:47\">PM</span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>In the meantime, here&apos;s a snap from Numis</p>\n</div></div>\n\n<div class=\"msg blockquote has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1461667637\" data-mid=\"1324982\" data-rawmessage=\"ALLIED MINDS.
