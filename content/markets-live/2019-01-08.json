Reiterate BUY and TP of 420p.\" id=\"webchat-msg-1433630\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">12:08pm</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><blockquote><p>Joules has traded impressively over Christmas with total retail sales up<br>\n+11.7% over the seven weeks to 6th January 2019. This is an acceleration<br>\nfrom the +10% delivered in H1, extending the group&apos;s track record of<br>\nconsistent outperformance vs. peers in a tough market. E-commerce<br>\naccounted for 50% of revenue, reflecting the strength of the group&apos;s online offer, balanced growth model and favourable positioning in light of the market&#x2019;s structural shifts. Our forecasts are unchanged but even more<br>\nsecure following this performance over peak. We expect continued doubledigit top line momentum over the long-term to be complemented by the capture of operational leverage from the group&apos;s well-invested infrastructure. Reiterate BUY and TP of 420p.</p></blockquote>\n</div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">Viking1</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBE thx .
