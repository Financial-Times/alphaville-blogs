First, our analysis<br>\nof the constitutional process showed that it was possible for the UK government<br>\nto extend Article 50 right up until the 29th March deadline.1 Previously we had<br>\nbeen concerned that extension might only be possible only with a complex and<br>\npotentially lengthy parliamentary process.</p></blockquote>\n</div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">A.
