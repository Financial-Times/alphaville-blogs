We also believe that the process would also be contingent on some form of equity fundraise.</p></blockquote>\n</div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">red</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdeb has to start being financially viable otherwise every rally will eventually get reversed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">taxgift45</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWhat sort of dilution can current Debenhams shareholders expect ?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1549971800\" data-mid=\"1436331\" data-rawmessage=\"Statement also chucks in some stuff about a strategic partnership with Li &amp; Fung .....\" id=\"webchat-msg-1436331\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">11:43am</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>Statement also chucks in some stuff about a strategic partnership with Li &amp; Fung .....</p>\n</div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">MassimoJ</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t@Lemmy - so goodwill wasn&apos;t written up, the assets were written down leaving a bigger gap between assets fair value and purchase price, right?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">red</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t@taxgift45given small mktcap u are looking at almost complete wipe out imo\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><time class=\"marketslive-timestamp o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2019-02-12T11:43:45.000Z\" title=\"Tue Feb 12 2019 11:43:45 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Tue Feb 12 2019 11:43:45 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t11:43 am\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1549971840\" data-mid=\"1436332\" data-rawmessage=\"The Hong Kong stuff supplier.\" id=\"webchat-msg-1436332\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">11:44am</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>The Hong Kong stuff supplier.</p>\n</div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">1st Lt.
