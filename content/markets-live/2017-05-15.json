The impacts of a weak Q1 have resulted in an increase in cost guidance to ZAR11,300/oz-ZAR11,800/oz (from ZAR10,800/oz-ZAR11,300/oz) and the company has cut its capex guidance to ZAR1.4bn-ZAR1.5bn (from ZAR1.8bn); this is likely to heighten concerns that the company is under-investing in the Marikana ore body.
