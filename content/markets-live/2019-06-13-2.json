Moreover Tesco continues to invest in its offer (including Centenary and clubcard offers, Jack&#x2019;s lines into mainline stores and the launch of a permanent &#x201C;Fresh 5&#x201D; fruit/veg offer) driving a lower rate of inflation versus the market and a volume outperformance quantified as +130bps vs. the IRI-defined competitor set (excl. German discounters). We would view the print as indicative of broadly flat LFL volumes against a tough PY weather comp, leaving Tesco well positioned to continue its operational outperformance.<br>\nBooker strength with +4.2% LFL ex-tobacco &#x2014; Booker posted LFLs of +3.1% inc. tobacco and +4.2% ex-tobacco (Citi +3.5%). This leaves the key non-tobacco metric on a two year stack of c.+16/+17%, as the wholesaler continues to make impressive progress into the teeth of a tougher HORECA end-market.</p></blockquote>\n</div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">red</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsundat trading regs mask problem in poland. tesco has no usp, its expensive. they have no pricing power here. similar to what m&amp;s suffered. diff mkt to uk.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><time class=\"marketslive-timestamp o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2019-06-13T10:38:10.000Z\" title=\"Thu Jun 13 2019 10:38:10 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Thu Jun 13 2019 10:38:10 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t11:38 am\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1560422305\" data-mid=\"1447436\" data-rawmessage=\"(@Excel -- can you really see the Fed cutting rates?

Majestic Retail is finding life very tough; this year&#x2019;s &#xA3;11m of EBIT is on a declining trend, and it doesn&#x2019;t strike us that there is much fat in the business. A 10x EBIT multiple seems punchy, and we&#x2019;d expect management to be delighted if it could secure a three figure sum. Debt would be paid down, but the majority of the cash would be used for future investment at Naked. There would still, though, be plenty left over for a serious special dividend: &#xA3;25m (about 30p) would be our guess, but we&#x2019;d emphasise that it is a guess. Management has not been drawn at all on this topic, which is fair enough at this stage of negotiations</p></blockquote>\n</div></div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1560422718\" data-mid=\"1447456\" data-rawmessage=\"(@red -- Help to Buy report I think -- see Tom&apos;s post: https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2019/06/13/1560415417000/Help--those-who-were-already-able--to-buy/)\" id=\"webchat-msg-1447456\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">JP</span><span class=\"timestamp\">11:45am</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>(@red -- Help to Buy report I think -- see Tom&apos;s post: <a href=\"https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2019/06/13/1560415417000/Help--those-who-were-already-able--to-buy/)\" target=\"_blank\">https://ftalphavil...ady-able--to-buy/)</a></p>\n</div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">Flaneur</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOn Trump - his calculation that tariffs on Mexico would force them to act also seems to be correct.On Gulf - yet another conveniently timed cassus belli..... starting to Douma head in...
