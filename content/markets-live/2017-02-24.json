This morning&#x2019;s release shows revenue, operating profit, and EPS ahead by 15%, 18%, and 18% YoY respectively to &#xA3;220m (SCF &#xA3;214.9m) &#xA3;16m (SCF &#xA3;159m) and 142.8p (SCF 134.6p). Year end net cash stood at &#xA3;17.8m (SCF &#xA3;10m) despite &#xA3;131m of dividends and share buy-backs reflecting characteristically strong cash (&gt;100% conversion from operating profit) and the full year dividend is being increased by 19% to 51.0p (SCF 46.5p)\n \nAverage monthly ARPA for the year rose by a better than expected 12% to a record  &#xA3;842m (SCF &#xA3;829) and agent / new home numbers increased by 2% to (SCF +1%) &#x2013; another highly impressive performance given the group&#x2019;s already dominant market position. Specifically, RMV&#x2019;s is now listing c.1m properties (1/3 higher than any other portal) and has seen a 10% increase in visits to over 120m with time spend on site ahead by 5%. Further product, software and data innovations have also been introduced to male the property marketplace more efficient and transparent for consumers and customers.\n \nOutlook comments indicate confidence in continued success in 2017, although there is unexpected news that CEO Nick McKittrick (who has been with the business for 16 years) has decided retire. Mr McKittrick will stay with the business until June and will be succeeded by Peter Brooks-Johnson who has been COO since 2011 so a high degree of continuity is expected.\n \nWe are long-standing bulls of RMV&#x2019;s market leading position, subscription driven business model, impressive record of EPS growth and upgrades, and its cash generative qualities. We also expect it to benefit from further structural growth in digital property advertising as the (still surprisingly substantial) proportion of agent spend garnered by off line media continues to diminish. We will revisit our financial forecasts in light of this morning&#x2019;s results (on a first pass basis we see scope for a mid single-digit FY2017F EPS upgrade). We note that the group&#x2019;s share price has appreciated by 16% since we upgraded our recommendation to Buy in mid November (+8% rel. over three months), but believe its valuation (FY2017F / FY2018F P/E and DY ratios of 28.9x / 1.2% and 25.6x / 1.3% respectively based on current forecasts) still offers scope for further upside in light of the trading performance and momentum highlighted evident in today&#x2019;s results.
