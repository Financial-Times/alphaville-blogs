AAL&#x2019;s full-year 2015 financials were dire, albeit ever so slightly ahead of both our expectations and that of consensus.\n \nFalling commodity prices (AAL&#x2019;s basket price was down 24% on 2014) meant that revenues were markedly down at US$20.46bn (2014: US$27.07bn), as was underlying EBIT of US$2.22bn (2014: US$4.93bn). These and US$5.7bn (post-tax) of impairments resulted in an attributable loss of US$5.62bn (2014: loss of US$2.51bn). Consensus was for revenue of US$20.56bn and a net loss of US$6.08bn.\n \nDespite various cost-savings initiatives and asset disposals, net debt was flat on 2014&#x2019;s US$12.9bn &#x2013; and indeed, up on July 2015&#x2019;s US$11.9bn (which had been flattered by the receipt of US$1.6bn from the sale of the Lafarge Tarmac interest) &#x2013; albeit slightly lower than guidance of US$13.0-13.5bn. The company noted that undrawn facilities and cash totalled US$14.8bn as of end 2015, albeit with near-term debt maturities of US$1.6bn in 2016 and US$2.6bn in 2017.\n \nAAL also put more flesh on the portfolio restructuring plan originally outlined in December 2015. There wasn&#x2019;t as much detail as we would have liked, and we would preferred to see announcements of actual disposals rather than more disposal plans. That said, we noted the following:\n&#xB7;         Bulk Commodities no longer core: The focus is now on &#x201C;De Beers, PGMs and copper&#x201D;, whereas AAL had previously said that it would focus on: De Beers, Industrial Metals (including platinum and base metals), Bulk Commodities (iron ore and coal). Indeed, AAL explicitly said that it is now considering &#x201C;options to exit [the Kumba iron ore operations] at the appropriate time, including a potential spin-out&#x201D;. Disappointingly, the Minas-Rio iron ore white elephant will remain for at least 3 years (at which point options will be assessed), we presume because that AAL has decided that it is unsaleable without having secured the licences required for the full ramp-up.\n\n&#xB7;         Atlatsa sacred PGM cow on the chopping block? PGMs have been elevated to a separate group, but we were disappointed that no mention was made about funding for this segment. AAL did say that assets not identified as part of the long-term core portfolio would be &#x201C;reviewed to determine the optimum path to realise shareholder value&#x201D;. We noted that the Atlatsa joint venture was not amongst those named for said portfolio. In the past, the cash-hungry Atlatsa had been viewed as a sacred cow on which AAL&#x2019;s BEE credentials rested, but it now seems to us that this sacred cow might end up on the chopping block after all.\n\n&#xB7;         Non-core disposals target upped to US$5-6bn: Unsurprisingly, given the above, the target for the disposals has been increased to &#x201C;$5-6 billion by end of 2016&#x201D;, of which US$3-4bn is expected in 2016 (US$2.1bn having been announced or completed in 2015).\n\n \nMeanwhile, capex is expected to be &lt;US$3.0bn in 2016 (25% down on 2015); in 2017, it is to be US$2.5bn. AAL is to focus on stay-in-business expenditure, but the company was careful to reassure that &#x201C;future performance will not be jeopardised for short term cash flow gains&#x201D;.\" id=\"webchat-msg-1313981\"><span class=\"messageheader par color-1\" title=\"11:26\">BE</span><div class=\"messagebody\"><blockquote><p>Full-year 2015 financials dire, if slightly ahead of expectations; iron ore and Atlatsa sacred cow on the chopping block; no details on Amplats funding plans. AAL&#x2019;s full-year 2015 financials were dire, albeit ever so slightly ahead of both our expectations and that of consensus.</p>\n<p>Falling commodity prices (AAL&#x2019;s basket price was down 24% on 2014) meant that revenues were markedly down at US$20.46bn (2014: US$27.07bn), as was underlying EBIT of US$2.22bn (2014: US$4.93bn). These and US$5.7bn (post-tax) of impairments resulted in an attributable loss of US$5.62bn (2014: loss of US$2.51bn). Consensus was for revenue of US$20.56bn and a net loss of US$6.08bn.</p>\n<p>Despite various cost-savings initiatives and asset disposals, net debt was flat on 2014&#x2019;s US$12.9bn &#x2013; and indeed, up on July 2015&#x2019;s US$11.9bn (which had been flattered by the receipt of US$1.6bn from the sale of the Lafarge Tarmac interest) &#x2013; albeit slightly lower than guidance of US$13.0-13.5bn. The company noted that undrawn facilities and cash totalled US$14.8bn as of end 2015, albeit with near-term debt maturities of US$1.6bn in 2016 and US$2.6bn in 2017.</p>\n<p>AAL also put more flesh on the portfolio restructuring plan originally outlined in December 2015. There wasn&#x2019;t as much detail as we would have liked, and we would preferred to see announcements of actual disposals rather than more disposal plans. That said, we noted the following:<br>\n&#xB7;         Bulk Commodities no longer core: The focus is now on &#x201C;De Beers, PGMs and copper&#x201D;, whereas AAL had previously said that it would focus on: De Beers, Industrial Metals (including platinum and base metals), Bulk Commodities (iron ore and coal). Indeed, AAL explicitly said that it is now considering &#x201C;options to exit [the Kumba iron ore operations] at the appropriate time, including a potential spin-out&#x201D;. Disappointingly, the Minas-Rio iron ore white elephant will remain for at least 3 years (at which point options will be assessed), we presume because that AAL has decided that it is unsaleable without having secured the licences required for the full ramp-up.</p>\n<p>&#xB7;         Atlatsa sacred PGM cow on the chopping block? PGMs have been elevated to a separate group, but we were disappointed that no mention was made about funding for this segment. AAL did say that assets not identified as part of the long-term core portfolio would be &#x201C;reviewed to determine the optimum path to realise shareholder value&#x201D;. We noted that the Atlatsa joint venture was not amongst those named for said portfolio. In the past, the cash-hungry Atlatsa had been viewed as a sacred cow on which AAL&#x2019;s BEE credentials rested, but it now seems to us that this sacred cow might end up on the chopping block after all.</p>\n<p>&#xB7;         Non-core disposals target upped to US$5-6bn: Unsurprisingly, given the above, the target for the disposals has been increased to &#x201C;$5-6 billion by end of 2016&#x201D;, of which US$3-4bn is expected in 2016 (US$2.1bn having been announced or completed in 2015).</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, capex is expected to be <us in down on it is to be us aal focus stay-in-business expenditure but the company was careful reassure that performance will not jeopardised for short term cash flow gains></us></p></blockquote>\n</div></div>\n\n<div class=\"msg blockquote has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1455622070\" data-mid=\"1313982\" data-rawmessage=\".... less than US$3.0bn in 2016 (25% down on 2015); in 2017, it is to be US$2.5bn.
