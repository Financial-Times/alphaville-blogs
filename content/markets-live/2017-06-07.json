After an initial reluctance to participate, RBS took &#xA3;5bn in Q4 2016 and a further &#xA3;9bn in Q1 2017, making it the single biggest user. We have little doubt that this &#xA3;14bn of 4-year money at 25bps can be substituted or deployed to good effect as RBS manages its liabilities more broadly, and sustains quite rapid &#x201C;core&#x201D; growth.<br>\nThe Attributable Profit of &#xA3;0.3bn achieved in Q1 2017 was after an &#x201C;accelerated&#x201D; &#xA3;0.6bn of restructuring charges. As such, we now model a &#xA3;0.5bn Attributable Profit in Q2 2017 before the losses resume in H2 2017e.<br>\nMaterial conduct risks and uncertainties remain, but on 0.8x Q1 2017 tNAV (297p) we upgrade to Hold (from Sell) and raise our TP to 260p (from 240p).</p></blockquote>\n</div></div><div class=\"msg separator has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1496831418\" data-mid=\"1380279\" data-rawmessage=\"11:30AM\" id=\"webchat-msg-1380279\">\n\t<div class=\"messagebody\"><time class=\"o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2017-06-07T10:30:18.000Z\" title=\"Wed Jun 07 2017 10:30:18 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Wed Jun 07 2017 10:30:18 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tundefined\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time></div></div><time class=\"marketslive-timestamp o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2017-06-07T10:30:44.000Z\" title=\"Wed Jun 07 2017 10:30:44 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Wed Jun 07 2017 10:30:44 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t11:30 am\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1496831459\" data-mid=\"1380280\" data-rawmessage=\"Plastics, then.\" id=\"webchat-msg-1380280\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">11:30am</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>Plastics, then.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1496831466\" data-mid=\"1380281\" data-rawmessage=\"http://www.ft.com/fastft/files/2013/10/03-1wordplastics.jpg\" id=\"webchat-msg-1380281\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">11:31am</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p><img class=\"picture\" src=\"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2F__origami%2Fservice%2Fimage%2Fv2%2Fimages%2Fraw%2Fhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.ft.com%252Ffastft%252Ffiles%252F2013%252F10%252F03-1wordplastics.jpg%3Fsource%3DAlphaville%26width%3D675%26fit%3Dscale-down?source=Alphaville\"></p>\n</div></div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1496829949\" data-mid=\"1380213\" data-rawmessage=\"It was pointed out to me earlier today that ML hasn&apos;t yet endorsed a General Election candidate.\" id=\"webchat-msg-1380213\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">11:05am</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>It was pointed out to me earlier today that ML hasn&apos;t yet endorsed a General Election candidate.</p>\n</div></div><time class=\"marketslive-timestamp o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2017-06-07T10:31:02.000Z\" title=\"Wed Jun 07 2017 10:31:02 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Wed Jun 07 2017 10:31:02 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t11:31 am\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time><div class=\"msg price has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1496831477\" data-mid=\"1380283\" data-rawmessage=\"&lt;strong&gt;RPC Group PLC (RPC:LSE):&lt;/strong&gt; Last: 830.00, down 20 (-2.35%), High: 885.00, Low: 788.00, Volume: 3.65m\" id=\"webchat-msg-1380283\">\n\t<div class=\"messagebody\"><strong>RPC Group PLC (RPC:LSE):</strong> Last: 830.00, down 20 (-2.35%), High: 885.00, Low: 788.00, Volume: 3.65m</div></div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1496831542\" data-mid=\"1380285\" data-rawmessage=\"FY ahead of consensus, though remember they said on March 30 that it would be.\" id=\"webchat-msg-1380285\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">11:32am</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>FY ahead of consensus, though remember they said on March 30 that it would be.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1496831577\" data-mid=\"1380286\" data-rawmessage=\"Adjusted EBITA at &#xA3;308m.
