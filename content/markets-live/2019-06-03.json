At this stage, however, we await more details<br>\non any financial implications and legal certainty before making changes to numbers.<br>\n&#x25CF; Assuming the issue remains contained to the Convatec contract, we believe this would be a<br>\nloss of revenue in the region of c$30m. Assuming typical gross margins, we believe this<br>\ncontract loss could see earnings downgrades c20% on an adjusted basis. However, this is<br>\nsubject to error and we expect more financial guidance from the company in the coming<br>\ndays and weeks.</p></blockquote>\n</div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">JimboRock</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tScarper\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1559560013\" data-mid=\"1446538\" data-rawmessage=\"Arden&apos;s also downgraded but I&apos;ve not been sent that one.\" id=\"webchat-msg-1446538\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">12:06pm</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>Arden&apos;s also downgraded but I&apos;ve not been sent that one.</p>\n</div></div><time class=\"marketslive-timestamp o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2019-06-03T11:06:50.000Z\" title=\"Mon Jun 03 2019 11:06:50 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Mon Jun 03 2019 11:06:50 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t12:06 pm\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time><div class=\"msg separator has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1559560025\" data-mid=\"1446539\" data-rawmessage=\"12:06PM\" id=\"webchat-msg-1446539\">\n\t<div class=\"messagebody\"><time class=\"o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2019-06-03T11:07:05.000Z\" title=\"Mon Jun 03 2019 11:07:05 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Mon Jun 03 2019 11:07:05 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tundefined\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time></div></div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1559560042\" data-mid=\"1446540\" data-rawmessage=\"Ocado downgrade will be over here shortly: https://www.ft.com/stocks-to-watch\" id=\"webchat-msg-1446540\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">12:07pm</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>Ocado downgrade will be over here shortly: <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stocks-to-watch\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.ft.com/stocks-to-watch</a></p>\n</div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">VV75</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthanks gents\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1559560068\" data-mid=\"1446542\" data-rawmessage=\"Once we close this and go do something useful with our day.
