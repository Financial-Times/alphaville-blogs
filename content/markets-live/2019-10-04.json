Some insurers have already moved ahead of the curve by ensuring vulnerable customers do not price walk into higher charges, or by introducing multi-year policies. Insurers are likely to reduce the initial discounts offered on new business, but the reduction in renewal premiums will be the dominant factor. Moreover, the industry&#x2019;s ability to increase new business premiums at a time of heightened public focus on switching/negotiating insurance prices is low.<br>\n&#x25A0; Soft pricing cycle likely to continue for longer, in our view. In our recent initiation we noted that regulatory intervention into the market would put downward pressure on pricing, leading to an extension of the current soft pricing cycle in UK motor. We think recent signs of the cycle improving are now likely to be revered as insurers cut prices on their renewal book. Remember renewal policies count for ~70% of business and so is the dominant factor in determining average premium inflation. Claims inflation in UK motor remains elevated at ~5% across the industry vs average premium declines of ~2% at H1 19 yoy.</p></blockquote>\n</div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">Tom Dalgleish</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t@Forester, there is an opportunity to aggregate accounts and obligations into a mega website but vendors won&apos;t cooperate\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1570185162\" data-mid=\"1455640\" data-rawmessage=\"A short thing from Shore:\" id=\"webchat-msg-1455640\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-2\">JP</span><span class=\"timestamp\">11:32am</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>A short thing from Shore:</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"msg blockquote has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1570185184\" data-mid=\"1455643\" data-rawmessage=\"Home insurers are more exposed than motor insurers as the relative price differences between new and renewal premiums are larger, partly due to the lack of price comparison website (PCW) penetration.

However it was the employment component that most were focusing on and like the equivalent sub component of the manufacturing data earlier this week, it didn&#x2019;t make for great reading after dropping 2.7pts to 50.4 and the lowest since February 2014. This has historically been a leading indicator for private payrolls so points at some real downside risk to payrolls over the coming months even if it doesn&#x2019;t show up today.</p>\n<p>The immediate reaction in markets to the data was a big rally across rates. Indeed 2y and 10y yields rallied the best part of 10bps and 7bps immediately and eventually closed last night near the lows at -9.0bps and -6.5bps respectively. The rally at the short end did mean the 2s10s curve steepened however and at 14.4bps is now at the steepest since early August. It was a similar story across other bond markets where in Europe 10y Bunds traded down to -0.590% (-4.3bps). Similarly Gold (+0.43%) turned in a third consecutive positive session.</p></blockquote>\n</div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">BornCynic</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNo more Mr Collins in the FT.
