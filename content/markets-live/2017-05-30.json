Average fares fell sharply (-19%, vs guidance of &#x2018;up to -15%&#x2019;), likely impacted by Easter shift out of March.

Average fares are expected to fall 5% through H1, which was weaker than our estimates (-2.5%) and that of peers (for example, Wizz Air is guiding for its overall RASK to be flattish this summer). The statement stresses that Ryanair still has limited visibility over peak summer close-in pricing, and we suspect there may be some upside to the outlook here if there are less geopolitical shocks this year (last year, shorthaul pricing across the industry was damaged by a number of demand impacts through June/July including Brexit and terrorism). Ryanair is not expecting load factor to rise in FY18, but reported forward bookings +1ppt, which in theory should translate into better year-on-year pricing at some point on the yield curve. Certainly, summer should have got off to a strong start with the move of Easter into April, and we expect questions on the call about the breakdown between Q1 and Q2 average fares.\n\n&#xB7;      Winter guide. Guidance suggests average fares should deteriorate to -8% in H2. Ryanair&#x2019;s tradition is to incorporate a &#x2018;worst case scenario&#x2019; winter guidance at this point in the year, and we expect the market to give it limited attention given there is no visibility. Based on the wider industry environment, there is no reason to assume a sequential decline in pricing into the winter. Furthermore, Ryanair will no longer be feeling an FX headwind, it does not appear to be ramping its growth into the winter, and Easter will partially shift back into March in 2018.\n\n&#xB7;      Ancillary revenues. Ancillary revenue per passenger has performed well over the last six months, rising mid single digits at constant currency. For FY18, guidance is flat, as Ryanair works on increasing penetration of ancillaries, funded by price discounts. Key focus is on reserved seating, priority boarding and fast track security. Non-flight initiatives such as accommodation and holidays remain in early stages.\n\n&#xB7;      Faster growth? Based on the outlook for legacy restructuring (Alitalia, airberlin, LOT) and its airport deal pipeline, Ryanair sees more growth opportunities than the current fleet delivery plan allows. The company is in discussion with Boeing about taking some additional 737-800s in 2018 and 2019, and is also aiming to extend 10 planned lease returns. We do not expect this to impact the FY18 growth rate, but it could take the FY19 and FY20 growth rate back to double-digit levels (currently guided to be +9% and +7% respectively). There is no change to the official fleet/growth plan today, as these discussions are still ongoing.\n\n&#xB7;      Share buyback. Ryanair has announced a &#x20AC;600m buyback programme, to start this week and complete by the end of October. The buyback will be confined to ordinary shares.
