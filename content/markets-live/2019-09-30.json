I read a lot about Thomas Cook this weekend, the business had approx &#xA3;3bn of net liabilities, masked by the goodwill and intangible assets on the balance sheet to provide a positive shareholders fund amount. In the 10 years to 2018 they had &#xA3;2.7bn of separately disclosed items,  paid tax of &#xA3;566m, Interest of &#xA3;1.3bn and facility set up fees of &#xA3;150m. In the end they just did not pay suppliers and hence funded their working capital to the point there was nothing left. They spent &#xA3;730m on intangible assets (mainly IT related) and spent &#xA3;1.35bn on tangible assets. Dividends were &#xA3;400m and net share issues were &#xA3;211. Let us remember that their accounting was poor, mytravel were censured by the FCA for poor accounting, Arcandor (the former parent) went bust and closed Quelle and their stake in TCG was placed with institutional shareholders, and in looking further Jet2 Holidays just ate their lunch and they were left with a high cost legacy product, namely retail booked package holidays in structural decline. (would you believe 48% of holidays were still booked thru the retail network). Basically all the tech savvy folks booked elsewhere, and Thomas Cook was left with offline sales.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><div class=\"msg blockquote has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1569839273\" data-mid=\"1455153\" data-rawmessage=\"e: 1) Bid risk/asset backing&#x2013;This year has seen many bids in the sectorwhich have highlighted the attractiveness of UK assets to foreign investors with the &#xA3; at lows andearnings somewhat cyclically depressed. ...

We concede this may put pressure on the ability to deliver on the new top line guidance (revised in July) of 2-3% LFL growth as well as on margin (guided at flat). While the market&#x2019;s pessimism on the equity story remains elevated, we would expect the stock performance to be pressured on a weak Q3 and to remain range bound into FY20 as the market awaits a strategic update from newly appointed CEO Laxman Narasimhan to 1) deliver a sustainable outperformance in Health and 2) driving RB2.0. We would continue to seek entry point on the share price weakness into what we see as one of the few turnaround stories in European staples.</p></blockquote>\n</div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">VV75</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tabstinence-only taught high schools are on the rise in the US under the current government, that is one explanation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">VV75</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t@IMP, I agree but it doesn&apos;t take much anymore to move that share these days\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">marktime</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIt involves more AI than that ... the grid is throttled to those who already have a full hot tank of water etc\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">A.
