Completion date is expected to be 3 Jan 2020.\nThe placing of &#xA3;157m of Bovis stock (9.99% of Bovis capital) will take place today with the funds going towards the purchase price. These shares will be eligible for the scrip dividend due in November (45p share) and the Bovis second interim dividend of 41p in May 2020.\nThe group indicates it has the capability to deliver 12,000 homes in the medium term, relative to JEFe of 10.2K in FY20.\nFor the first time Bovis has disclosed its planned targeted synergies: &#xA3;35m by YE21. Of this &#xA3;20m is targeted from operating costs and &#xA3;15m from procurement (although we believe the latter number may have some upside potential).\nReflecting the higher balance sheet of Galliford at YE19 compared to when the acquisition was announced, Bovis now indicates a gearing including land creditors which is mid 30% when the deal is done, coming down to &lt;25% by YE21.\nThe balance of achieving these two items implies EPS enhancement which is mid single digit in FY20 and mid teens EPS enhancing in FY21.\nBovis will pay the second part of its capital return (&#xA3;180m total over 3 years) as previously indicated by way of a bonus issue of shares. Reflecting the share placement this is now &#xA3;66m reflecting the increased number of eligible share post the placing (still equivalent to 45p/share). The group has confirmed a 41p dividend will be payable in cash in May 2020 (to those shareholders at 27 Dec).
