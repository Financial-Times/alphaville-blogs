For Brush, in the absence of details on the restructuring, we reduce our 2018 estimates inline with the commentary but expect this to be only a point in time change; management plans to significantly restructure and improve the business and we see our previous forecast level of profit (&#xA3;20m+) potentially achievable once management has implemented its plans. We therefore expect to be reversing this downgrade in the future once we have clarity on the scale and timing of the restructuring. The net impact of our changes is 0%<em>-5%</em>-5% to our 2017/2018/2019 EBITA estimates.</p></blockquote>\n</div></div><div class=\"msg blockquote has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1511263710\" data-mid=\"1400793\" data-rawmessage=\"We update our Sum of the Parts valuation but our December 2018 Price Target remains unchanged.

Revenue visibility remains strong, with 92%/59% of FY18/FY19 revenue in place vs. 2Q update: 89%/59%. The bid pipeline increased to &#xA3;12.2bn vs &#xA3;10.5bn at FY17, while the order book reduced slightly to to &#xA3;18.5bn vs. &#xA3;19bn at FY17 Cash conversion post capex was 60%, down from 79% in 1H17 driven by working capital, timing; management expects this to normalise by the end of the financial year.</p>\n<p>Overall, while we believe that the reiteration of the FY18 outlook should be taken positively, the concerns around the slight slowdown in FY19 revenue growth could weigh on sentiment. However, we note that the shares have been weak YTD, down<br>\n21%, so it should be in the price.</p></blockquote>\n</div></div><time class=\"marketslive-timestamp o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2017-11-21T11:44:13.000Z\" title=\"Tue Nov 21 2017 11:44:13 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Tue Nov 21 2017 11:44:13 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t11:44 am\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1511264668\" data-mid=\"1400820\" data-rawmessage=\"Worth noting that BAE doesn&apos;t seem to he caught by the NSCR review thing.\" id=\"webchat-msg-1400820\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">11:44am</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>Worth noting that BAE doesn&apos;t seem to he caught by the NSCR review thing.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"msg price has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1511264673\" data-mid=\"1400821\" data-rawmessage=\"&lt;strong&gt;BAE Systems PLC (BA.:LSE):&lt;/strong&gt;

This is especially true for its completion activities. While we think its business model has some disadvantages (distribution centres, supplying bigger oil services companies), it possesses key technologies (e.g. H-1 perforating guns), a sound balance sheet, and we expect its top line and margin to improve markedly in 2017-20E. Although the significant share rebound since the low in early 2016 (c. 100%) already seems to price in part of the expected operating improvement, downside risks are low, and we still see further c. 30% upside.
