We raise our mkt forecasts and adjust our PTs, highlight PENN and WMH as favored names. We have restructured our US sports betting model, taking a view on online vs. onground, and now forecast a $7B market in 2025 vs. our $5B market forecast made in June 2018 and reiterated in December. While the pace of legalization has actually been slightly slower than we expected, market revenue has been higher, driven by stronger per capita spending, especially in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. We believe we were missing 2 things in our earlier forecasts: 1) that while US bettors likely won&apos;t spend the same as in the UK or Australia, a significant portion of the betting in those countries is on horse racing, that will be re-distributed to sports here in the US; and 2) online sports betting is still a growing industry globally, putting upward pressure on eventual US spending. We expect online sports betting to reach $5B of revenue in 2025, and onground to reach $1.5B. For the first time, we are forecasting online vs. onground revenue separately. Onground revenue is driven by proximity to population masses, and popularity of the physical destination, so we forecast based on penetration of existing casino revenue. In contrast, we forecast online revenue based on spend per adult, which we see as properly capturing the broader market opportunity. Our 2025 online forecasts $52 annual online sports betting spend / adult, supported by New Jersey&apos;s Sept annualized rate of ~$40, and Australia / UK&apos;s $45 / $43 (for context, $81 / $57 with horse racing). We forecast onground revenue at 2% of existing casino revenue, similar to what 5 states are averaging today. Together this implies $35 annual sports betting revenue per adult in the 36 US states that we expect to legalize. Lower margin expectations. We now forecast industry EBITDA margins to mature at 25% vs. 30% before. We had forecasted state gaming tax rates to settle out at 15% and while a weighted average of the states that are legal today would imply 15.1%, we expect to see upward pressure. Pennsylvania has the highest tax rate (excluding states run by the lottery) at 36%, which many including ourselves expected to significantly constrain market size. However, the market has been a relative success, so we expect future state legislators to push for higher tax rates. In addition, the cost of marketing / promotional spending as well as media and league partnerships have been higher than we expected. These two factors more than offset expected lower Federal excise taxes because of higher gross win margins, and lower G&amp;A as a % of revenue given a larger market size. Stock implications. With 16 months of data, as well as more recent app download data, we&apos;ve taken a more definitive view on market share than our prior assumption of giving each of our companies 10%. In the markets we expect they will access, we forecast the legacy DFS players, FanDuel (FLTR) and DraftKings, to reach 15-20% share, FOX Bet, William Hill and Bet365 to reach 10% share, and Roar (MGM/GVC), theScore, and PointsBet 5.0-7.5% share.\" id=\"webchat-msg-1458343\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">11:30am</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><blockquote><p>With 19 states legalized, 14 live, 11 reporting monthly data, and a good mix with &amp; without mobile betting, we have a clearer picture of what US sports betting will look like, and who the beneficiaries should be. We raise our mkt forecasts and adjust our PTs, highlight PENN and WMH as favored names. We have restructured our US sports betting model, taking a view on online vs. onground, and now forecast a $7B market in 2025 vs. our $5B market forecast made in June 2018 and reiterated in December. While the pace of legalization has actually been slightly slower than we expected, market revenue has been higher, driven by stronger per capita spending, especially in Pennsylvania and New Jersey.

We currently forecast YoY declines of 3.0% and 0.5% in agent numbers during FY19F and FY20F, respectively having moderated our expectations at the half year &#x2013; notably the first time that we can recall reducing our assumptions on underlying agent numbers following a RMV results announcement.</p>\n<p>Whilst we would not generally expect agents to entirely de-list from Rightmove for financial reasons, we do think that there is real potential for them to opt for more basic, lower cost listings packages to reduce their overheads and / or divert spend to other lower-cost portals with the intention of increasing their reach and profile and, crucially, improving their ability to secure listings. By way of an example of an alternative option, OTMP has recently signed 2,000 agent offices at an average ARPA of &#xA3;297 per month.</p></blockquote>\n</div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">Irish HF guy</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t@YourGrannyOnBongos, but we can scale it to every news and blog site in the world so it is potentially appealing to SoftBank / Vision Fund.

Taq Taq produced<br>\n10.9 kb/d vs 13.1kb/d in 1H19. 5% lower production at Tawke to 120kb/d gross was<br>\nflagged by operator DNO yesterday.<br>\n&#x2022;<br>\nDrilling at production hubs continues. The TT-34 well at Taq Taq is currently drilling<br>\nand should be completed later in the month, which we think is likely to add another 1.5<br>\nkb/d at the field, in line with previous wells. TT-35 will spud in December, targeting the<br>\nnorthern flank of the field. At Tawke, three wells are expected to come online shortly.<br>\n&#x2022; Q3 financials on track. FCF $45M (1H19 $76M), capex $38M (1H19 $72M) and net<br>\ncash $115M (1H19 $56M). Capex guidance is maintained &quot;towards the top end of<br>\n$150-170M&quot;.
