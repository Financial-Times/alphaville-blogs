In terms of valuation, recent transactions in the European sector have been transacted at multiples ranging from c13-18x EBIT, (or 10-15x EBITDA) pre synergies falling significantly post synergies which are often targeted at up to c4% of sales (with a low of 2%) &#x2013; post synergy multiples have fallen to more like 8-13x EBIT. However, we would note that: (1) these have generally been smaller transactions for private companies; and (2) it is questionable if this level of synergies would be available in a trans-Atlantic deal of this nature. As an example of the range of potential valuation scenarios, if a post synergy EBIT multiple of 10x was used (broadly at the mid point of past transactions), this would equate to an EV range of c&#x20AC;11-14bn based on 2-4% synergies, which translates into an equity range of more like &#x20AC;9-11bn. We base our Smurfit price target of &#x20AC;30 on 7.7x 17E EV/EBITDA.</p></blockquote>\n</div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">Soundbuy</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t@Forester - exactly.........\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1520336540\" data-mid=\"1411828\" data-rawmessage=\"&#x20AC;30 is, what, just below &#xA3;27?
