The guidance raise is driven<br>\nby a lower than expected erosion of Suboxone film by generic competition since<br>\nlaunches in Feb, while all other guidance remains unchanged, including Sublocade<br>\nguidance of $50m-$70m (JEFe $60m).<br>\nRecent data shows Suboxone film share continues to hold up. As we show in the<br>\nchart below, our analysis of IQVIA data suggests that Suboxone film&apos;s share of the<br>\nBuprenorphine/naloxone film market has held up relatively well and the rate of share<br>\nloss has slowed. Additionally, the Authorised generic with INDV&apos;s partner, Sandoz,<br>\nhas captured significantly more share than the other generics.</p></blockquote>\n</div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">FATDAZ</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t@Tom a reprise of the East India Company lol\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><div class=\"msg blockquote has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1562840470\" data-mid=\"1449841\" data-rawmessage=\"Crucially, INDV&apos;s revised guidance implies that share erosion of Suboxone film\naccelerates towards the rate of historic analogues.

This will report into Diploma&#x2019;s Seals division.<br>\nVSP financials &#x2013; In FY18 VSP reported revenues of &#xA3;35.7m and PBT of &#xA3;5.8m. The deal is expected to be earnings enhancing immediately, we would expect<br>\nto see consensus earnings move up c+5% today.<br>\nAcquisition multiple &#x2013; The initial cash consideration (before acquisition costs) is &#xA3;56m and represents a multiple of 9x adjusted historical operating profit,<br>\nwhich we see as an attractive acquisition multiple. A further &#xA3;8m of deferred consideration of up to &#xA3;8m may be payable in 2020 subject to operating profit<br>\ntargets.<br>\nFunded through cash and net debt facilities &#x2013; The acquisition will be funded through existing cash resources and new debt facilities.
