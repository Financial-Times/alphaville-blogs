For example, we estimate that on an ex-Carphone basis, the shares trade on less than 7.5x CY18e earnings. As earnings show signs of stabilisation on an underlying basis (i.e. PBT of c. &#xA3;400m, EPS of 26-27p), the risk/reward balance now lies on the upside in our view. We retain our 185p DCF/SoTP-derived TP and upgrade to BUY.</p></blockquote>\n</div></div><time class=\"marketslive-timestamp o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2017-11-09T11:43:06.000Z\" title=\"Thu Nov 09 2017 11:43:06 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Thu Nov 09 2017 11:43:06 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t11:43 am\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1510227801\" data-mid=\"1399343\" data-rawmessage=\"Please imagine I posted that earlier, underneath the Dixons waffle.\" id=\"webchat-msg-1399343\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">11:43am</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>Please imagine I posted that earlier, underneath the Dixons waffle.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"msg separator has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1510227811\" data-mid=\"1399344\" data-rawmessage=\"11:43AM\" id=\"webchat-msg-1399344\">\n\t<div class=\"messagebody\"><time class=\"o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2017-11-09T11:43:31.000Z\" title=\"Thu Nov 09 2017 11:43:31 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Thu Nov 09 2017 11:43:31 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tundefined\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time></div></div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1510227938\" data-mid=\"1399345\" data-rawmessage=\".............. so.
