This is where investors are likely to have a bit of an issue. If we look at Bloomberg consensus, on a &#x2018;Standard&#x2019; basis, which includes 22 forecasts, consensus FY2019 adj net income is &#x20AC;1,365m, i.e. in line with the top of the guidance range. However, if we use the &#x2018;last 28 days&#x2019; consensus, this only includes eight estimates, and consensus is &#x20AC;1,436m, which implies a c5% cut. Our current forecast is &#x20AC;1,393m (so a c2.5% cut to our numbers at the middle of the range). The company is citing investment in new products, home dialysis and China (the company announced some small acquisitions here on Wednesday). If management can persuade the street that this is really about investment (rather than underlying pricing pressure), the downside for the shares is likely to be more limited, in our view.</p></blockquote>\n</div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">red</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmkt expectations for lvl of cut quite low now. think 1mln enough to sup crude for now. not ruling out a btd moment tho on release.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">Pharma</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t@Flaneur, that article on arrears contains the answer to the increase.
