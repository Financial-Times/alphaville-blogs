Having warned at the time of its AGM on 7th Sep (and re-confirmed in a trading statement on 29th Sep), that net operating income (revenue) was expected to be down year-on year (yoy), the results show a decline of 4% to &#xA3;75.5m for the period. This translates into a steep yoy fall in EBITDA down 27% to &#xA3;21.9m (margin down 9ppts yoy to 29%), with underlying PBT down 29% at &#xA3;18.8m and underlying eps down 29% at 5.1p. An interim dividend of 2.98p, was declared (33% of the prior year dividend) albeit the company&#x2019;s policy of paying out 50% of earnings will imply a cut in the full year dividend from last year&#x2019;s 9.83p unless management choose to regard the current year as exceptional in the context of a five year plan to grow net operating income to &#xA3;220m by y/e Mar 2020. Overall the profit fall (costs up 9% in a period where revenue was down 4%) will make it difficult for CMC to achieve our current full year PBT forecast of &#xA3;58.7m, especially as current trading is simply described as having seen &#x2018;no further easing&#x2019; and we would expect to be downgrading by c10%, subject to any further detail at the 11am results presentation.\n \nGrowth in active clients was up 8% yoy at 47,623 indicating a further slowdown in the month of September (this metric had been +13% after 3m to 30th June and up 9% for the 5m to 31st  Aug). However, lower volatility meant that clients traded less with average revenue per client down 13% to &#xA3;1488 with Europe picked out as being particularly weak. An update on regulation also flags potential restrictions on digital marketing in Europe and wider conduct issues (from unregulated foreign exchange and binary operators) attracting negative media attention. We see CMC operating very much at the quality end of the regulated markets.\n \nThe statement flags that if there is no improvement in client trading levels in H2 (and we would remind investors that the company will lap a very strong comparative in Jan/Feb where markets had been very volatile in 2016) then full year net operating income may be below last year&#x2019;s level which was &#xA3;169.4m (we currently forecast &#xA3;171.3m). However, our current full year EBITDA margin assumption of 38.4% (versus 40.9% last year) now looks very challenging.\n \nAt last night&#x2019;s closing price of 203p and before any change to forecasts (provisionally down c10%), CMC trades on 12.5x our Mar &#x2019;17 adjusted eps of 16.2p, falling to 10.6x in Mar &#x2019;18 (19.2p) and a prospective Mar &#x2019;17 dividend yield of 4.4% (9.0p). These metrics represent a material discount to closest peer IG Group (IGG, Sell at 837p), currently trading on 17.5x our May &#x2019;17 adjusted eps. We believe IG&#x2019;s longer track record and stronger recent execution merits a premium. Our last published fair value for CMC was 240p, based on 13.5x 12m forward adjusted eps (a 10% discount to our IG fair value multiple). While this theoretically represented sufficient upside to consider moving to a more positive recommendation, the proximity of the profit warning to February&#x2019;s 240p IPO (and the fact that even our low end numbers needed a decent H2) meant we thought the company may have to spend a period in the &#x2018;sin bin&#x2019; as confidence with investors is rebuilt. Based on this morning&#x2019;s results and likely downgrades we expect to be reducing our fair value (and increasing the discount to IG) to somewhere closer to 200p.

This translates into a steep yoy fall in EBITDA down 27% to &#xA3;21.9m (margin down 9ppts yoy to 29%), with underlying PBT down 29% at &#xA3;18.8m and underlying eps down 29% at 5.1p. An interim dividend of 2.98p, was declared (33% of the prior year dividend) albeit the company&#x2019;s policy of paying out 50% of earnings will imply a cut in the full year dividend from last year&#x2019;s 9.83p unless management choose to regard the current year as exceptional in the context of a five year plan to grow net operating income to &#xA3;220m by y/e Mar 2020. Overall the profit fall (costs up 9% in a period where revenue was down 4%) will make it difficult for CMC to achieve our current full year PBT forecast of &#xA3;58.7m, especially as current trading is simply described as having seen &#x2018;no further easing&#x2019; and we would expect to be downgrading by c10%, subject to any further detail at the 11am results presentation.</p>\n<p>Growth in active clients was up 8% yoy at 47,623 indicating a further slowdown in the month of September (this metric had been +13% after 3m to 30th June and up 9% for the 5m to 31st  Aug). However, lower volatility meant that clients traded less with average revenue per client down 13% to &#xA3;1488 with Europe picked out as being particularly weak. An update on regulation also flags potential restrictions on digital marketing in Europe and wider conduct issues (from unregulated foreign exchange and binary operators) attracting negative media attention. We see CMC operating very much at the quality end of the regulated markets.</p>\n<p>The statement flags that if there is no improvement in client trading levels in H2 (and we would remind investors that the company will lap a very strong comparative in Jan/Feb where markets had been very volatile in 2016) then full year net operating income may be below last year&#x2019;s level which was &#xA3;169.4m (we currently forecast &#xA3;171.3m). However, our current full year EBITDA margin assumption of 38.4% (versus 40.9% last year) now looks very challenging.</p>\n<p>At last night&#x2019;s closing price of 203p and before any change to forecasts (provisionally down c10%), CMC trades on 12.5x our Mar &#x2019;17 adjusted eps of 16.2p, falling to 10.6x in Mar &#x2019;18 (19.2p) and a prospective Mar &#x2019;17 dividend yield of 4.4% (9.0p). These metrics represent a material discount to closest peer IG Group (IGG, Sell at 837p), currently trading on 17.5x our May &#x2019;17 adjusted eps. We believe IG&#x2019;s longer track record and stronger recent execution merits a premium. Our last published fair value for CMC was 240p, based on 13.5x 12m forward adjusted eps (a 10% discount to our IG fair value multiple). While this theoretically represented sufficient upside to consider moving to a more positive recommendation, the proximity of the profit warning to February&#x2019;s 240p IPO (and the fact that even our low end numbers needed a decent H2) meant we thought the company may have to spend a period in the &#x2018;sin bin&#x2019; as confidence with investors is rebuilt. Based on this morning&#x2019;s results and likely downgrades we expect to be reducing our fair value (and increasing the discount to IG) to somewhere closer to 200p.
