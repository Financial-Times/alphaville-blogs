We increase our PT to &#x20AC;46 mostly coming from: 1) peer re-rating (1-turn in last 3 months); 2) a narrower discount to IHG, reflecting greater confidence in value-creation and improving Services PMIs. Our upside case, which reflects full value crystallization (and 40% of mkt cap returned as cash), increases to &#x20AC;54 (+38% upside potential) mainly on the peer re-rating. This does not reflect a potential takeout (noting recent speculation from Betaville via Bloomberg) where we see a blue sky mid-point of &#x20AC;60 (+53% upside). Accor is now our preferred hotel pick and IHG remains our least preferred.</p></blockquote>\n</div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">Tom Dalgleish</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t@Cloudy, more QA in those places would be a start\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1563791047\" data-mid=\"1450590\" data-rawmessage=\"Here&apos;s more on the bid angle .....\" id=\"webchat-msg-1450590\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">11:24am</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>Here&apos;s more on the bid angle .....</p>\n</div></div><time class=\"marketslive-timestamp o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2019-07-22T10:24:22.000Z\" title=\"Mon Jul 22 2019 10:24:22 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Mon Jul 22 2019 10:24:22 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t11:24 am\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time><div class=\"msg blockquote has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1563791077\" data-mid=\"1450591\" data-rawmessage=\"As we discussed in the previous section looking at the upside case, we see substantial upside potential for Accor if the assets were to be disposed and cash returned to shareholders.
