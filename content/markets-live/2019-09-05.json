Talk of consolidation in the elevator industry has stepped up since Thyssenkrupp decided to IPO it&apos;s elevator business - we expect this business to be acquired/merged before it lists, with Kone the most likely buyer given the smaller geographical overlap. There has been talk for a long time of the elevator industry going from 4 to 3 global players, and perhaps this is Otis thinking of buying Schindler before Kone buys or merges with Thyssenkrupp as it&#x2019;s very hard to see competition authorities allowing just 2 global players.
