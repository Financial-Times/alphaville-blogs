While some mature markets might come under pressure from a slower macro, we see the outlook supported by structural migration online and new gambling verticals opening. Further, the sector still provides structurally attractive investment opportunities, in our view, given cyclical pressures on other parts of the leisure sector. We prefer diversified, scale players with strong cash generation to fund expansion. We reiterate our Buys on TSG/GVC, while Neutral-rated PPB&#x2019;s US opportunity appears priced in. We remain cautious on Neutral-rated WMH (execution risk scaling down its retail business/leverage profile).

On most underwriting metrics (premium, large losses, weather and attritional) commentary is in-line to slightly better than expected, but there is reserve strengthening which we weren&apos;t expecting, and the FX drag is worse. Detail: Premiums: NWP grew +3% in reported terms, and was flat underlying (in-line), driven by Scandinavia +3% (UBSe: +1%), Canada +8% (UBSe: +8.5%) and UK -5% (UBSe: -5%). Profitability: RSA notes operating profit for 1Q19 was up vs. 1Q18 at constant FX, but flat in reported terms, with an improving COR offset by lower investment income. For 1H19E, we forecast &#xA3;341m of operating profit vs. &#xA3;304m in 1H18, so this looks weaker vs. our estimates. RSA reported 3.2% of weather (UBSe: 3.3%), with Canada elevated and UK / Scandi benign as expected. Large losses were 8.5ppt (UBSe: 9.5%), driven by better UK. Reserve releases look to be ~0% (UBSe: 1.5%) driven by some strengthening on 2018; this looks to be the main driver of the miss vs. our estimates.

On most underwriting metrics (premium, large losses, weather and attritional) commentary is in-line to slightly better than expected, but there is reserve strengthening which we weren&apos;t expecting, and the FX drag is worse. Detail: Premiums: NWP grew +3% in reported terms, and was flat underlying (in-line), driven by Scandinavia +3% (UBSe: +1%), Canada +8% (UBSe: +8.5%) and UK -5% (UBSe: -5%). Profitability: RSA notes operating profit for 1Q19 was up vs. 1Q18 at constant FX, but flat in reported terms, with an improving COR offset by lower investment income. For 1H19E, we forecast &#xA3;341m of operating profit vs. &#xA3;304m in 1H18, so this looks weaker vs. our estimates.

Divergence in price trends across key grades\nSince the peak late-2018, containerboard prices have steadily eroded in Europe, with FOEX PIX kraftliner prices so far down by 11% and testliner by 15%, driven by weak demand, increasing inventories in the value chain and low-priced imports from the US.\nThe knock-on effect on corrugated board has so far been marginal, but the pressure is building. On the other hand, uncoated fine paper prices have held up surprisingly well despite pulp prices turning down, with FOEX PIX prices still showing a modest 1% increase year-to-date. Also, sack kraft papers have stabilised at a high level (2019 German spot price up 4-6% vs. 2018 average assuming stable prices going forward), with downstream industrial bags passing through the paper price increases On balance overall stable earnings outlook for 2019\nOn aggregate, and considering the earnings outlook for 2019, we believe price pressure has increased a bit, especially due to continued declines in containerboard prices. Also, cost inflation is running at c2% and Mondi will have c&#x20AC;40m more in maintenance costs this year. However, there are also mitigating factors: acquisitions (Powerflute) should add some &#x20AC;30-40m y-o-y, and benefits from growth projects (Steti) c&#x20AC;60m. Consensus EBITDA currently stands at &#x20AC;1.76bn (flat y-o-y).\nValuation: Buy; we update PT to reflect Plc and FX\nMondi had a strong start to the year, but the price outlook is mixed and current trends, especially in containerboard pricing, bring some uncertainty to estimates.

Despite short-term headwinds, we think Mondi remains well positioned longer term with its low-cost asset base and growth investments supporting margins and returns.\" id=\"webchat-msg-1444211\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">11:59am</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><blockquote><p>Q1 19 adjusted EBITDA ahead of estimates<br>\nIn its trading update, Mondi reported Q1 19 adjusted EBITDA of &#x20AC;471m, which was ahead of our expectation of &#x20AC;398m (no consensus available), but mainly driven by deviations in timing effects of pricing (limited containerboard price erosion q-o-q) and maintenance costs (only &#x20AC;15m vs. 90m H1); we assume Q2 19 EBITDA will trade down. Divergence in price trends across key grades<br>\nSince the peak late-2018, containerboard prices have steadily eroded in Europe, with FOEX PIX kraftliner prices so far down by 11% and testliner by 15%, driven by weak demand, increasing inventories in the value chain and low-priced imports from the US.<br>\nThe knock-on effect on corrugated board has so far been marginal, but the pressure is building. On the other hand, uncoated fine paper prices have held up surprisingly well despite pulp prices turning down, with FOEX PIX prices still showing a modest 1% increase year-to-date. Also, sack kraft papers have stabilised at a high level (2019 German spot price up 4-6% vs. 2018 average assuming stable prices going forward), with downstream industrial bags passing through the paper price increases On balance overall stable earnings outlook for 2019<br>\nOn aggregate, and considering the earnings outlook for 2019, we believe price pressure has increased a bit, especially due to continued declines in containerboard prices. Also, cost inflation is running at c2% and Mondi will have c&#x20AC;40m more in maintenance costs this year. However, there are also mitigating factors: acquisitions (Powerflute) should add some &#x20AC;30-40m y-o-y, and benefits from growth projects (Steti) c&#x20AC;60m. Consensus EBITDA currently stands at &#x20AC;1.76bn (flat y-o-y).<br>\nValuation: Buy; we update PT to reflect Plc and FX<br>\nMondi had a strong start to the year, but the price outlook is mixed and current trends, especially in containerboard pricing, bring some uncertainty to estimates.
