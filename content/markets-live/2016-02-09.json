This statement is disappointing, particularly coming so soon after the last profit warning and will further dent investor confidence. Whilst we believe the underlying market remains strong, we are concerned about management&#x2019;s lack of visibility into future costs. We are also concerned that guidance may slip further once the new CFO is appointed and further detail on the outlook for FY16 is available.</p></blockquote>\n</div></div>\n\n<time class=\"marketslive-timestamp o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2016-02-09T11:59:53.000Z\" title=\"Tue Feb 09 2016 11:59:53 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Tue Feb 09 2016 11:59:53 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t11:59 am\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1455019208\" data-mid=\"1312909\" data-rawmessage=\"And Barclays.\" id=\"webchat-msg-1312909\"><span class=\"messageheader par color-1\" title=\"12:00\">BE</span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>And Barclays.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n<div class=\"msg blockquote has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1455019213\" data-mid=\"1312910\" data-rawmessage=\"Cambian&#x2019;s trading update this morning guides for 2015 revenue of &#xA3;292m vs. our estimate of &#xA3;290m and adjusted EBITDA to be not less than &#xA3;46m vs. our expectations of &#xA3;49m.
