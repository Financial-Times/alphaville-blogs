It mirrors the ban placed against shipping to ZTE this time last year, but ZTE had been found to break sanctions and also the ensuing explicit agreements made as part of its reparations (Huawei has not recently been accused of such, although U.S. officials have been attempting to build a case) and ZTE is also smaller and less critical to China&#x2019;s technology development than Huawei. Any response by China directly against U.S. technology companies could be just as significant given the importance of China, both as a manufacturing partner and as a direct consumer of goods with electronic content. A further escalation risks muddying the waters further for what is a highly complicated and intertwined global supply chain, leading to a potential overall slowing the market.</p></blockquote>\n</div></div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1558433804\" data-mid=\"1445509\" data-rawmessage=\"In terms of the effect ....\" id=\"webchat-msg-1445509\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">11:16am</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>In terms of the effect ....</p>\n</div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">Grouchmonkey</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMorning all\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><div class=\"msg blockquote has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1558433861\" data-mid=\"1445510\" data-rawmessage=\"We see European vendors effected in two ways: 1. if they have products containing US-source IP, then those would theoretically be barred from shipment to Huawei even if they are owned by a European company [e.g. ams bought a US company Princeton Optronics and the IP from Princeton is used in lasers they sell to Huawei for 3D sensing]\" id=\"webchat-msg-1445510\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">11:17am</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><blockquote><p>We see European vendors effected in two ways: 1. if they have products containing US-source IP, then those would theoretically be barred from shipment to Huawei even if they are owned by a European company [e.g. ams bought a US company Princeton Optronics and the IP from Princeton is used in lasers they sell to Huawei for 3D sensing]</p></blockquote>\n</div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">Grouchmonkey</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAny discussion on Huawei impact on, e.g. IQE?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><time class=\"marketslive-timestamp o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2019-05-21T10:17:42.000Z\" title=\"Tue May 21 2019 10:17:42 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Tue May 21 2019 10:17:42 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t11:17 am\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time><div class=\"msg blockquote has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1558433877\" data-mid=\"1445511\" data-rawmessage=\"and 2. if critical elements coming from US companies are barred, then Huawei may be unable to finish the manufacturing of the device and therefore any other components would sit in WIP inventory.\" id=\"webchat-msg-1445511\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">11:17am</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><blockquote><p>and 2. if critical elements coming from US companies are barred, then Huawei may be unable to finish the manufacturing of the device and therefore any other components would sit in WIP inventory.</p></blockquote>\n</div></div><div class=\"msg blockquote has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1558433881\" data-mid=\"1445512\" data-rawmessage=\"If a bottleneck existed around one critical part, then Huawei is unlikely to continue buying all other parts as normal, as they would simply build inventory and burn cash.

The under pressure clinical and commercial business delivered underlying growth of 1% which was much better than the expectations for -5% given management&apos;s comments at the full year results in November. The Communications and Advisory business was slightly down on an underlying basis however the STEM investments were an 8% headwind here so this business looks to be performing well.\n\nSharp was a stark contrast, with the US delivering EBIT growth of 22% underlying but the European business providing a $1.6m loss.
