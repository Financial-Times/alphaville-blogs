However, in our view, these are rectifiable over the medium term if the business units are managed properly. We recognise this is not a quick fix. Our view is based on historic performance, peer group analysis and industry commentary. If the new management team succeeds, then the company should be able to take advantage of a recovery in its defence end markets as well as a pickup in its commodity-related activities, which should lead to low/mid single-digit revenue growth towards the end of the decade and a recovery of margins towards the mid-teens. This is well above what recent cuts to consensus imply (we forecast a 12.5% margin in FY19E). Cash generation should also improve substantially back to historic levels.

Cobham is now a recovery stock, in our view.\" id=\"webchat-msg-1366138\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">11:16am</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><blockquote><p>The Buy case: Cobham has many problems. However, in our view, these are rectifiable over the medium term if the business units are managed properly. We recognise this is not a quick fix. Our view is based on historic performance, peer group analysis and industry commentary. If the new management team succeeds, then the company should be able to take advantage of a recovery in its defence end markets as well as a pickup in its commodity-related activities, which should lead to low/mid single-digit revenue growth towards the end of the decade and a recovery of margins towards the mid-teens. This is well above what recent cuts to consensus imply (we forecast a 12.5% margin in FY19E). Cash generation should also improve substantially back to historic levels. Longer term, there is the potential to reposition the portfolio. Cobham is now a recovery stock, in our view.</p></blockquote>\n</div></div><time class=\"marketslive-timestamp o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\"

ROTE was 14.2% in FY16, and a 17% ROTE on the FY16 tangible equity f &#xA3;2.9bn or 281p per share would be equivalent to 47.7p per share. A 17% ROTE on our previously published FY18 tangible book value per share estimate of 321p would be equivalent to a 54.6p per share.</p>\n<p>Solvency capital in line at 158% (top end of range) - legacy sale will add 17 to 20 points</p>\n<p>RSA&#x2019;s Solvency capital was in line with our expectations at 158%, at the top end of its 130-160% range. As the company disclosed earlier in the month, the sale of legacy will add an additional 17-20 points to its Solvency 2 ratio, equivalent to &#xA3;300-350m of capital. As we discussed in our note &#x201C;RSA - Legacy sales accretive to Sol 2 and EPS&#x201D; (8 Feb 2017), we believe the company will use this excess capital to pay down its expensive debt, which could increase FY18 earnings estimates by c3.5%. This is not in our estimates as it depends on which debt the company decides to pay down. The company has confirmed that this is what it intends to do with the excess capital.</p>\n<p>Full-year dividend increased by 52% to 16.0p, 5% ahead of consensus and equivalent to a 41% payout.</p>\n<p>RSA increased the dividend by 52% to 16.0p, 5% ahead of consensus estimates and equivalent to a 2.7% yield and a 41% payout. The company has reiterated that its medium-term policy is for an ordinary dividend of 40-50%, with additional payouts (specials) where justified. The company has also stated that the additional payouts should follow the completion of restructuring and progress in the unwind of unrealized bond gains. With limited top-line growth, we expect the company to start to pay regular special dividends by 2018 &#x2013; 62.5% payout in 2018 (when the restructuring is complete) and 75% payout from 2019 onwards when the unrealized bond unwind is largely done.</p></blockquote>\n</div></div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1487851116\" data-mid=\"1366243\" data-rawmessage=\"And JP Morgan.\" id=\"webchat-msg-1366243\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">11:58am</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>And JP Morgan.</p>\n</div></div><time class=\"marketslive-timestamp o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2017-02-23T11:58:50.000Z\" title=\"Thu Feb 23 2017 11:58:50 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Thu Feb 23 2017 11:58:50 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t11:58 am\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time><div class=\"msg blockquote has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1487851145\" data-mid=\"1366244\" data-rawmessage=\"RSA has this morning reported strong FY16 results.
