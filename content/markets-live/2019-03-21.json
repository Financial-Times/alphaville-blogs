ESMA Retail customers were 1.5% higher than<br>\nthey were in Q2 18, and 3.6% higher than our estimate, which we view as positive (although we would caution against placing too much emphasis on a single<br>\nquarter).<br>\nWe continue to view the shares as undervalued, and affirm our Outperform rating, but note our Speculative Risk qualifier. Market conditions are always difficult to<br>\nforecast (customers prefer upward trending markets, with moderate volatility) and, at the new lower levels of leverage (which makes trading less &#x201C;exciting&#x201D;, all<br>\nelse equal), the trading activity of ESMA Retail customers in any given period, is currently more challenging to project.<br>\nHowever, we believe IG has the ability to adapt to the changed regulatory environment, with plans to launch an exchange-traded offering for the Continental<br>\nEuropean market in May 2019, and having already launched (January) a US retail FX offering in the US.</p></blockquote>\n</div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">VV75</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin fairness they did have a fairly strong comparative yoy because of the crypto hype last year\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">Flaneur</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThis ties on with Next results.

The dividend was in line with UBSe at 165p. Within the mix, Retail was a shade better than UBSe on a better H2 cost performance. Online was a shade lower with less cost leverage. Next Finance profit was also slightly lower, although the H1 rise in bad debts has subsided. YE net debt was &#xA3;1,096m vs UBSe &#xA3;1,158m, with slightly lower than UBSe growth in the debtor book. Guidance unchanged, Label and International shine, bad debt lower\nFY20 PBT guidance remains at &#xA3;715m. Retail EBIT margin is expected to compress by 350bp (FY19 170bp), in part likely from lower markdown benefit as well as higher gearing on a lower base margin. Retail sales are expected to decline 8.5%. Online margin is expected to hold steady at c18.5% on sales up 11%. Dilution from Label should be offset by lower print costs. Label and Overseas are growing strongly. FY20 combined sales guidance is &#xA3;930m, 24% of Next Brand product sales, and 20% up on FY19. Bad debt guidance is for a decline from 4.5% to 4.2% as the impact of historical internal credit decisions washes out.\nUBS estimates unchanged, lower bad debts\nUBS FY20E PBT remains at &#xA3;725m, slightly higher than guidance as we expect some share gains from capacity reduction in the mid market. The key issue is whether Next can grow profit over the medium term.

The dividend was in line with UBSe at 165p. Within the mix, Retail was a shade better than UBSe on a better H2 cost performance. Online was a shade lower with less cost leverage. Next Finance profit was also slightly lower, although the H1 rise in bad debts has subsided.

Guidance unchanged, Label and International shine, bad debt lower<br>\nFY20 PBT guidance remains at &#xA3;715m. Retail EBIT margin is expected to compress by 350bp (FY19 170bp), in part likely from lower markdown benefit as well as higher gearing on a lower base margin. Retail sales are expected to decline 8.5%. Online margin is expected to hold steady at c18.5% on sales up 11%. Dilution from Label should be offset by lower print costs. Label and Overseas are growing strongly. FY20 combined sales guidance is &#xA3;930m, 24% of Next Brand product sales, and 20% up on FY19.
