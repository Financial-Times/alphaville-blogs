We prefer IAG on valuation grounds and would avoid Ryanair and Deutsche Lufthansa. Airlines have been a poor investment over the past two years, is it time to buy? We think it may be too soon: we see three headwinds for the sector in Europe, which are not fully priced in the shares. (1) Competition is not yet receding at a fast enough pace. (2) Fuel and environmental costs could be on the rise and we think future fuel efficiency gains are less of a cost advantage than the market perceives. (3) Labour costs look likely to exceed inflation. And, while the sector is trading close to trough multiples, it is not on trough earnings (or returns), and we see scope for further downside. Our earnings estimates are, on average, 7% below consensus for CY19 EPS. Long-term, we see some scope for optimism. We estimate margins implied in consensus estimates are below managements&apos; targets for all Airlines, so assuming their medium-term ambitions are met, we see significant upside potential for all stocks under our coverage (included in our bull cases). However, we think the best time to own airlines, based on history, is when returns and cash flows start to inflect - we do not think we are at that point yet: trough multiples, without signs of recovery, are not a good enough reason to buy the sector.

On the other hand, we would argue that best-in-class Ryanair (Underweight, PT &#x20AC;8.00) is unlikely to achieve the same level of premium returns versus peers that it has historically; competitors&apos; returns have recovered somewhat and Ryanair will have to invest (i.e. reduce unit revenues) to ensure its leadership in the EU and grow above market rates. We think the premium contraction has been overlooked. Risks to the earnings outlook for Deutsche Lufthansa (Underweight, PT &#x20AC;12.00) persist and even if the group succeeds in normalizing returns, execution and, hence, pricing in the earnings rebound, will take time in our view. We think our ratings, on a relative basis, should stand regardless of the macro backdrop. We rate Air France-KLM, easyJet and Wizz Air Equal-weight. Where we could be wrong. Due to weak demand and, in part, due to the grounding of the 737 MAX, capacity growth for winter 2020 and summer 2020 has been coming down.

IAG has a strong track record of cost cutting and delivery of targets, which is not reflected in the share price. The skies haven&apos;t been blue for IAG. IAG is operating under difficult conditions: its largest carrier BA has been suffering pilot strikes, which we estimate could cost the group up to &#x20AC;150mn in 2019, IT issues, and it needs to reinvest to improve services and keep its market share on its premium (and profitable) classes.

Finally, IAG has a strong track record on executing self help: it was able to achieve a decline in unit cost by 19%, 800bps better than the peer average in 2012-2018.

Despite having above average FCF generation, returns and cost execution, IAG is trading at trough multiples both in absolute (3.8x 2-year forward PE) and relative terms (0.6x sector PE, vs historical trading at 0.8x). Moreover, IAG EV/IC relative to premium over cost of capital is amongst the most attractive in the sector. This signals that the negatives have been priced in by more than peers.
