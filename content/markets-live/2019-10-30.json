There have been some wild gyrations in the sector in the last two months driven primarily by a hope or belief that a no deal Brexit was off the table. Now, however, we have replaced what appeared to be confidence with fresh doubt and uncertainty and, as we wrote a few days ago, we believe that uncertainty is a killer for the housing market. As there is a great deal of uncertainty about the outcome on December 12th and the two parties that might occupy No. 10 will have polar opposite agendas, we believe that many buyers will now adopt a wait-and-see position.\n\n \n\nThe house builders had been buoyed by 1) the hope that a no deal Brexit had been avoided; 2) that Brexit will deliver a substantial economic dividend; 3) that a Budget on 6th November would slash Stamp Duty and set the housing market alight. All of these seemed increasingly certain and we have seen most stocks swing from 12 months lows to 12 month or even all time highs. Now we face a pause at least in the market that is likely to straddle the year end and flow into early 2020. If the Tories are returned, an emergency Budget will come in the early days of January we feel that buyers and sellers will want to wait to see what extra incentives and stimuli are introduced. If Labour wins, buyers are likely also to wait to see what attacks there might be on personal wealth and other confidence sappers. Both potential outcomes point to hiatus.\n\n \n\nWe have discussed all of the potential issues before but we see a loss of sales momentum in the key push for December year-end sales, a dent in forward order books and the likely need to offer more incentives to buyers through the end of 2019 and into the new year. Previously we have only really been concerned about the impact of wider market pricing on margins due to the loss of house price momentum but now we also need to be concerned about weaker sales volumes and an additional bout of pricing pressure via incentive and higher selling costs that are unique to new homes.

There have been some wild gyrations in the sector in the last two months driven primarily by a hope or belief that a no deal Brexit was off the table. Now, however, we have replaced what appeared to be confidence with fresh doubt and uncertainty and, as we wrote a few days ago, we believe that uncertainty is a killer for the housing market. As there is a great deal of uncertainty about the outcome on December 12th and the two parties that might occupy No. 10 will have polar opposite agendas, we believe that many buyers will now adopt a wait-and-see position.</p>\n<p>The house builders had been buoyed by 1) the hope that a no deal Brexit had been avoided; 2) that Brexit will deliver a substantial economic dividend; 3) that a Budget on 6th November would slash Stamp Duty and set the housing market alight. All of these seemed increasingly certain and we have seen most stocks swing from 12 months lows to 12 month or even all time highs. Now we face a pause at least in the market that is likely to straddle the year end and flow into early 2020. If the Tories are returned, an emergency Budget will come in the early days of January we feel that buyers and sellers will want to wait to see what extra incentives and stimuli are introduced. If Labour wins, buyers are likely also to wait to see what attacks there might be on personal wealth and other confidence sappers. Both potential outcomes point to hiatus.</p>\n<p>We have discussed all of the potential issues before but we see a loss of sales momentum in the key push for December year-end sales, a dent in forward order books and the likely need to offer more incentives to buyers through the end of 2019 and into the new year. Previously we have only really been concerned about the impact of wider market pricing on margins due to the loss of house price momentum but now we also need to be concerned about weaker sales volumes and an additional bout of pricing pressure via incentive and higher selling costs that are unique to new homes. Private buyers and sellers can afford to sit the uncertain times out but house builders have targets and expectations to meet.</p></blockquote>\n</div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">Are we there yet</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tComments section change is OK - but nothing like the real-time back and for you get here\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><time class=\"marketslive-timestamp o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2019-10-30T11:18:32.000Z\" title=\"Wed Oct 30 2019 11:18:32 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Wed Oct 30 2019 11:18:32 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t11:18 am\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time><div class=\"msg blockquote has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1572434327\" data-mid=\"1458056\" data-rawmessage=\"he house building sector is one prone is quick and severe knee-jerk reactions and we have seen how far and how fast share prices have moved on even the merest whiff of pivotal change.

As the hostels install new reservation booking systems and as more money is being invested in global hostel brands they are typically third party booking systems of which Hostelworld is just 1 booking engine.  I remember being in 1 hostel and the guy could not book me at the desk, I had to go on hostelworld to book. Those days are gradually disappearing.

We note that for FY 2019e consensus (Reuters Eikon) expects EBITDA adjusted of &#x20AC;1,623m; this is up 5% y-o-y or &#x20AC;78m but includes IFRS 16 (leasing) effects of c&#x20AC;80m, which makes for an assumption of flat underlying EBITDA. A key focus point on the conference call will be on box pricing (we expect flattish box prices y-o-y in 2019 and -3% in 2020, which translates into -6% from the peak late-2018); Mondi (Buy) recently said in its trading update that the willingness among producers to pass on more of the containerboard decline to box pricing has increased recently. Previously DS Smith (Neutral) indicated 1-3% lower box pricing into Q3 19. However, we do not expect SKG to give implicit guidance on pricing.</p></blockquote>\n</div></div><time class=\"marketslive-timestamp o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2019-10-30T11:37:02.000Z\" title=\"Wed Oct 30 2019 11:37:02 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Wed Oct 30 2019 11:37:02 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t11:37 am\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time><div class=\"msg blockquote has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1572435437\" data-mid=\"1458095\" data-rawmessage=\"Valuation: Buy, PT &#x20AC;33; How would we expect investors to react?\nA: Slightly positively.
