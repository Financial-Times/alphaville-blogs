The UK&#x2019;s trade deficit was -&#xA3;4.8bn in February, far above consensus expectations of -&#xA3;3.4b. With January data getting a sharp downward revision to -&#xA3;5.2b from the previous estimate of -&#xA3;3.5b, this puts the UK on a concerning course to beat its record current account deficit (7% of GDP) in the final quarter of last year. In the three months to February, the UK&#x2019;s deficit to the rest of the EU reached a record &#xA3;23.8bn. This was driven by a rise in imports of 1.1% and a fall in exports of 1.3% </p>\n<p>Swelling trade deficit adds to UK current account troubles ahead of EU referendum. In recent years, the combination of weaker exports of goods to the EU alongside a fall in the returns the UK gets on its overseas investments has grown the UK&#x2019;s current account deficit from a modest problem to a serious one. In the final quarter of last year, the UK ran the largest current account deficit on record at 7% of GDP (see chart). The UK&#x2019;s current account deficit is the biggest in the G7 and, heading into the EU referendum on the 23 June, it is a growing cause for concern. We see the risk of a Brexit at 35%. If a Brexit does happen, the is a risk that if investors suddenly fear that, because of the negative economic effects of a Brexit, the UK can no longer meet its obligations later on without a massive devaluation, they might attempt to exit their sterling positions in a hurry. This gives way to our key Brexit tail risk. Although it remains a low probability event and is not our central forecast, we pay close attention to the risk of a sterling crisis.</p></blockquote>\n</div></div>\n\n<div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1460111849\" data-mid=\"1322209\" data-rawmessage=\"And a chart ....\" id=\"webchat-msg-1322209\"><span class=\"messageheader par color-1\" title=\"11:37\">BE</span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>And a chart ....</p>\n</div></div>\n\n<time class=\"marketslive-timestamp o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2016-04-08T10:37:19.000Z\" title=\"Fri Apr 08 2016 10:37:19 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Fri Apr 08 2016 10:37:19 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t11:37 am\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1460111854\" data-mid=\"1322210\" data-rawmessage=\"http://i.imgur.com/3U1RxCU.jpg\" id=\"webchat-msg-1322210\"><span class=\"messageheader par color-1\" title=\"11:37\">BE</span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p><img class=\"picture\" src=\"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2F3U1RxCU.jpg?source=Alphaville\"></p>\n</div></div>\n\n<div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1460111907\" data-mid=\"1322211\" data-rawmessage=\"Hey, speaking of Brexit .....\" id=\"webchat-msg-1322211\"><span class=\"messageheader par color-1\" title=\"11:38\">BE</span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>Hey, speaking of Brexit .....</p>\n</div></div>\n\n<div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1460111937\" data-mid=\"1322212\" data-rawmessage=\"Deutsche updates its models.\" id=\"webchat-msg-1322212\"><span class=\"messageheader par color-1\" title=\"11:38\">BE</span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>Deutsche updates its models.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n<time class=\"marketslive-timestamp o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2016-04-08T10:39:23.000Z\" title=\"Fri Apr 08 2016 10:39:23 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Fri Apr 08 2016 10:39:23 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t11:39 am\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time><div class=\"msg blockquote has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1460111978\" data-mid=\"1322213\" data-rawmessage=\"&#xF06E; At the front end, the market continues to attach a Brexit premium to the\nmoney market curve, pricing a first hike in H1 2020 and a ~45% chance of\ncuts by the end of this year.\n&#xF06E; In a vote to remain in the EU, a hawkish re-pricing of the BoE&#x2019;s path would\nlead to significant re-steepening.
