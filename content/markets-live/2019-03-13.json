Cost savings ahead of plan, streamlined management, commitment to maintain DPS &#x201C;during the period of transformation&#x201D; should be well received. Alongside moves to liquidate investment stakes on Monday, outlook ex-flows looks good.<br>\n&#xF06E; Board Change &#x2014; Many investors have been expecting some change since Sir Douglas Flint became Chair at the start of this year. As of today, single CEO (Keith Skeoch) and from 1 June, new CFO (Stephanie Bruce).<br>\n&#xF06E; Costs &#x2014; &#xA3;1.4bn costs, down 10% yoy, helped by plans to target &#xA3;350m merger and model simplification savings. Integration ahead of schedule, actions already taken to deliver &#xA3;175m savings, of which &#xA3;120m seen in 2018. SLA also achieved a further reduction in underlying costs of &#xA3;56m due to other efficiencies.<br>\n&#xF06E; Earnings (see p. 2-3) &#x2014; &#xA3;650m PBT was 9% ahead of Citi, 5% consensus: &#xA3;510m Asset Management and Platform (Citi &#xA3;515m) and &#xA3;140m Associates/JVs (&#xA3;80m).<br>\n&#xF06E; &#xA3;40.9bn net outflows &#x2014; vs. Citi &#xA3;46.0bn and Consensus &#xA3;40.3bn. &#xA3;551.5bn AuM 3% better than Citi &#xA3;536.0bn. More equity and less Strategic Insurance Partners outflows than we expected, and more slowdown in Elevate/Wrap flows 1H-2H.<br>\n&#xF06E; Questions &#x2014; Reasons for DPS confidence, Plans for &#xA3;0.6bn surplus capital, full &#xA3;750m buyback (&#xA3;358m so far), further investment stake sales, further cost savings. Outlook for flow recovery, impact of Elevate platform fee cuts.
