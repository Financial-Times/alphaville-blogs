Peak trading was in line with company expectations, with UK electricals market share increasing 30bps, driven by gaming (+60% yoy), Smart Tech, SDA and Vision.<br>\nUK Mobile was impacted by lower volumes of 24 month postpay (market decline of 8%) and growth in new longer than 24 months postpay segment. iD mobile displayed growth with the customer base reaching 975K and UK Credit improved strongly with customer base reaching 802K (711K in FY18).<br>\nGross margins remain stable across the group.<br>\nOther KPIs: UK electricals online sales grew 8% yoy, representing 28% (+2ppt yoy) of total sales. International online sales grew 22%.<br>\nGuidance: Dixons Carphone has left the guidance unchanged (FY19 PBT of &#xA3;300m)<br>\nWhat does it all means? Keeping all things equal, we expect company-compiled consensus FY19 PBT of &#xA3;297m (-25% yoy) to remain stable.</p></blockquote>\n</div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">wayneJ</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t@1st - and apologies in your direction too!\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><time class=\"marketslive-timestamp o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2019-01-22T12:05:19.000Z\" title=\"Tue Jan 22 2019 12:05:19 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Tue Jan 22 2019 12:05:19 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t12:05 pm\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1548158734\" data-mid=\"1434804\" data-rawmessage=\"And RBC.\" id=\"webchat-msg-1434804\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">12:05pm</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>And RBC.</p>\n</div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">wayneJ</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRe Dixons - one has to wonder exactly what creature CPW really was\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><div class=\"msg blockquote has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1548158756\" data-mid=\"1434805\" data-rawmessage=\"Dixons Carphone is a very lowly priced share and has a strong relative market position in all its markets.
