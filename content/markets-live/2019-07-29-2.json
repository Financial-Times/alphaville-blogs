The price implies 11.7x Q1 19 annualised EBITDA. Refinitiv&apos;s net debt stands at $12.2bn, so LSE would have to issue ~$14.8bn or ~&#xA3;11.8bn of equity to finance the deal. In the statement, the company details &#xA3;350m of run-rate cost synergies (9% of Refinitiv&apos;s 2018 costs ex D&amp;A or 8% of combined opex) in 5 years after completion and &apos;strong&apos; adjusted EPS accretion in the first full year after completion. Talks are advanced on board membership and governance. LSE&apos;s Chairman Don Robert, CEO David Schwimmer and CFO David Warren are expected to continue in their roles and discussions around lock-up provisions are on-going with Refinitiv shareholders who intend to be long-term shareholders. The terms of any transaction remain subject to LSEG Board approval and there can be no certainty that a transaction will be forthcoming. Any transaction would be conditional, inter alia, upon the approval of LSEG shareholders and antitrust and regulatory clearances, as well as other customary conditions.Financial impact: LSE indicates that it expects the deal to be earnings accretive from the first full year of completion (we assume it would be from 2020). At 26th July closing share price less 5% discount, we estimate that the group would need to issue 219m shares or 60% of current market cap to fund the deal. Based on 2018 financials, Refinitiv generated $6.3bn of revenues $1.6bn of EBITDA. This compares to LSE reported revenue of &#xA3;2.1bn ($2.7bn), EBITDA &#xA3;1bn ($1.3bn) - implying a combined group with ~$9bn/&#xA3;7bn in revenues. Cost synergies of &#xA3;350m to be delivered by year 5 equate to 9% of target OPEX and 8% of combined OPEX. Treatment of D&amp;A would be key to earnings accretion given is it material at refinitive ($479m at Q1 19, $1916m annualised). Including depreciation but excluding amortization costs we estimate ~30% of potential EPS accretion (1). What is Refinitiv? Refinitiv was carved out of Thomson Reuters in October 2018 with a majority stake sold to a PE consortium led by Blackstone (55%) while Thomson Reuters retained the remaining 45% stake. It is a global financial data and market infrastructure provider with 40,000 customers across 190 countries. The Data platform provides real-time market data, Reuters news, analytics and risk management tools. Refintiv also has a trading business with platforms including FXAll and Matching as well as a majority stake in Tradeweb. Post transaction with Blackstone, Refinitiv embarked on a cost cutting program with $650m target savings by 2020. $350m has already been achieved at Q1 19 and two-thirds of target expected by end 2019.Strategic rationale to expand data business and diversify trading capabilities: LSE Group has focused on two principle sources of structural growth in recent years - (1) post trade risk mitigation (per LCH deal) (2) data analytics/index (per FTSE Russell deals) and it is these areas that have driven double digit top line and above sector earnings growth.

This  is  not  the  first  time  LSE  has  entered a new market through M&amp;A (e.g., LCH &amp; Russell acquisitions in 2013-14, both of  which  were  successful  deals).  Refinitiv  offers  data  (including  distribution  through  Eikon),  FX  &amp;  Fixed  income  trading  platforms  (e.g.,  TradeWeb,  FXall,  Matching)  and  portfolio analytics/risk management solutions. Subscription revenues accounted for just 77-80% of Refinitiv&apos;s revenues over 2017-18. Refinitiv&apos;s regional revenue split has been about 40/40/20 for N America/EMEA/Asia Pac over the past 2 years.Valuation: We Rate LSE Neutral with 5,550p Price TargetAt 26x 2020 UBSe earnings, we view LSE as fairly valued.
