In our forecasts we take at face value the expectations that Sainsbury&apos;s has set out for the cost of extracting synergy benefits from the integration of Argos and in particular the progressive rationalisation of the fascia&#x2019;s real estate, incorporating re-locations within Sainsbury stores, and the ongoing broader lowering of operating costs. Should Argos go to plan then we foresee strong medium-term compound earnings growth coming through.</p></blockquote>\n</div></div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1484133699\" data-mid=\"1359872\" data-rawmessage=\"(I&apos;m pro Sainsbury-Argos, FWIW, which requires being relatively pro Habitat. *Not investment advice*)\" id=\"webchat-msg-1359872\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-2\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">11:21am</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>(I&apos;m pro Sainsbury-Argos, FWIW, which requires being relatively pro Habitat. <strong>Not investment advice</strong>)</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"msg blockquote has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1484133703\" data-mid=\"1359873\" data-rawmessage=\"Of equal significance to us is the potential improvement to the Sainsbury&apos;s balance sheet from a successful integration of Argos, noting the aforementioned novel funding of the acquisition outlined above.

In the short-term, we believe Cobham`s valuation will inevitably suffer accordingly.</p></blockquote>\n</div></div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1484134459\" data-mid=\"1359915\" data-rawmessage=\"The June low as 127, so will see if it tests that\" id=\"webchat-msg-1359915\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">PM</span><span class=\"timestamp\">11:34am</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>The June low as 127, so will see if it tests that</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1484134489\" data-mid=\"1359916\" data-rawmessage=\"Thereafter we&apos;d be back to 2005 levels\" id=\"webchat-msg-1359916\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">PM</span><span class=\"timestamp\">11:34am</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>Thereafter we&apos;d be back to 2005 levels</p>\n</div></div><time class=\"marketslive-timestamp o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2017-01-11T11:34:40.000Z\" title=\"Wed Jan 11 2017 11:34:40 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Wed Jan 11 2017 11:34:40 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t11:34 am\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1484134495\" data-mid=\"1359917\" data-rawmessage=\"Not pretty\" id=\"webchat-msg-1359917\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">PM</span><span class=\"timestamp\">11:34am</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>Not pretty</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"msg separator has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1484134562\" data-mid=\"1359920\" data-rawmessage=\"11:35AM\" id=\"webchat-msg-1359920\">\n\t<div class=\"messagebody\"><time class=\"o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2017-01-11T11:36:02.000Z\" title=\"Wed Jan 11 2017 11:36:02 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Wed Jan 11 2017 11:36:02 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tundefined\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time></div></div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1484134575\" data-mid=\"1359921\" data-rawmessage=\"Should we congratulate Paul McDade becoming CEO of Tullow?\" id=\"webchat-msg-1359921\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">PM</span><span class=\"timestamp\">11:36am</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>Should we congratulate Paul McDade becoming CEO of Tullow?</p>\n</div></div><time class=\"marketslive-timestamp o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2017-01-11T11:36:13.000Z\" title=\"Wed Jan 11 2017 11:36:13 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Wed Jan 11 2017 11:36:13 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t11:36 am\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1484134588\" data-mid=\"1359922\" data-rawmessage=\"Oh, hang on\" id=\"webchat-msg-1359922\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">PM</span><span class=\"timestamp\">11:36am</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>Oh, hang on</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1484134603\" data-mid=\"1359923\" data-rawmessage=\"Aidan Heavey moving up to chairman\" id=\"webchat-msg-1359923\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">PM</span><span class=\"timestamp\">11:36am</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>Aidan Heavey moving up to chairman</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1484134620\" data-mid=\"1359924\" data-rawmessage=\"That&apos;s bad governance!\" id=\"webchat-msg-1359924\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">PM</span><span class=\"timestamp\">11:37am</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>That&apos;s bad governance!</p>\n</div></div><time class=\"marketslive-timestamp o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2017-01-11T11:36:56.000Z\" title=\"Wed Jan 11 2017 11:36:56 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Wed Jan 11 2017 11:36:56 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t11:36 am\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1484134631\" data-mid=\"1359925\" data-rawmessage=\"It&apos;s for a &quot;transitionary period&quot; -- 2 years tho\" id=\"webchat-msg-1359925\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">PM</span><span class=\"timestamp\">11:37am</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>It&apos;s for a &quot;transitionary period&quot; -- 2 years tho</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"msg blockquote has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1484134648\" data-mid=\"1359926\" data-rawmessage=\"Aidan Heavey&apos;s appointment as non-executive Chairman reflects the Board&apos;s belief that, owing to the unique nature of Tullow&apos;s business and relationships across Africa, a phased transition in the leadership of the Group is appropriate.

With the successful reset of the business under the leadership of founder CEO Aidan Heavy with the stake sale of Uganda being the last bit of the jigsaw, the company announced the decision to appoint Paul McDade, current COO of TLW, to be the next CEO of the company. The energy sector in particular is a relationship business, especially so across Africa, where Paul has been effectively running the business for TLW in Ghana, Uganda and Kenya. Aidan will stay on as Chairman for up to two years to ensure an effective transition. Other updates worth highlighting from today&apos;s release include (a) slightly lower production guidance for TEN in 2017 (now expecting gross 50kbd), albeit this was previously flagged, but not yet quantified, and (b) capex of $0.5bn in 2017, albeit it is likely to be less than $0.4bn once the transaction with Total in Uganda is completed.\n\n&#xF0A7; Investment Overview: After years of heavy investment, TLW has reached an inflection point in its cash cycle as the ramp-up of production from TEN should allow the company to slowly deleverage - generating free cash flow at less than  $50/bbl in 2017. Its flagship asset, Jubilee, produced below capacity in early 2016 due to issues with the FPSO, and a timetable for permanent repairs has been established. TLW has insurance to cover both the cost of repairs and revenues from lost production at Jubilee. TLW announced an agreement to farm-down a stake in Uganda to Total further de-risking balance sheet concerns - it should de-gear fast from hereon at our macro.\n\n&#xF0A7; Catalysts and Risks: TLW has commenced the next phase of its Kenyan exploration program in December, in an effort to grow the resource base towards 1bnbbls gross (from 750mmbbls), which we think is necessary to attract partners to fund the export pipeline for commercial production.\n\n&#xF0A7; Valuation: We set our TP in line with our DCF based risked NAV, which uses a long-term $65/bbl Brent oil price assumption.\" id=\"webchat-msg-1359943\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-2\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">11:45am</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><blockquote><p>This report was published on 11 January 2017 at 08:32:02 AM UTC.

Other updates worth highlighting from today&apos;s release include (a) slightly lower production guidance for TEN in 2017 (now expecting gross 50kbd), albeit this was previously flagged, but not yet quantified, and (b) capex of $0.5bn in 2017, albeit it is likely to be less than $0.4bn once the transaction with Total in Uganda is completed.</p>\n<p>&#xF0A7; Investment Overview: After years of heavy investment, TLW has reached an inflection point in its cash cycle as the ramp-up of production from TEN should allow the company to slowly deleverage - generating free cash flow at less than  $50/bbl in 2017. Its flagship asset, Jubilee, produced below capacity in early 2016 due to issues with the FPSO, and a timetable for permanent repairs has been established. TLW has insurance to cover both the cost of repairs and revenues from lost production at Jubilee. TLW announced an agreement to farm-down a stake in Uganda to Total further de-risking balance sheet concerns - it should de-gear fast from hereon at our macro.</p>\n<p>&#xF0A7; Catalysts and Risks: TLW has commenced the next phase of its Kenyan exploration program in December, in an effort to grow the resource base towards 1bnbbls gross (from 750mmbbls), which we think is necessary to attract partners to fund the export pipeline for commercial production.</p>\n<p>&#xF0A7; Valuation: We set our TP in line with our DCF based risked NAV, which uses a long-term $65/bbl Brent oil price assumption.</p></blockquote>\n</div></div><div class=\"msg separator has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1484135180\" data-mid=\"1359944\" data-rawmessage=\"11:46AM\" id=\"webchat-msg-1359944\">\n\t<div class=\"messagebody\"><time class=\"o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2017-01-11T11:46:20.000Z\" title=\"Wed Jan 11 2017 11:46:20 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Wed Jan 11 2017 11:46:20 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tundefined\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time></div></div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1484135193\" data-mid=\"1359945\" data-rawmessage=\"Request for Foxtons on the right\" id=\"webchat-msg-1359945\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">PM</span><span class=\"timestamp\">11:46am</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>Request for Foxtons on the right</p>\n</div></div><time class=\"marketslive-timestamp o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2017-01-11T11:46:27.000Z\" title=\"Wed Jan 11 2017 11:46:27 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Wed Jan 11 2017 11:46:27 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t11:46 am\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1484135202\" data-mid=\"1359947\" data-rawmessage=\"Shall we oblige?\" id=\"webchat-msg-1359947\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">PM</span><span class=\"timestamp\">11:46am</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>Shall we oblige?</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1484135204\" data-mid=\"1359948\" data-rawmessage=\"Okay, Foxtons.\" id=\"webchat-msg-1359948\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-2\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">11:46am</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>Okay, Foxtons.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"msg price has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1484135210\" data-mid=\"1359949\" data-rawmessage=\"&lt;strong&gt;Foxtons Group PLC (FOXT:LSE):&lt;/strong&gt; Last: 95.42, down 3.58 (-3.62%), High: 95.75, Low: 86.75, Volume: 1.08m\" id=\"webchat-msg-1359949\">\n\t<div class=\"messagebody\"><strong>Foxtons Group PLC (FOXT:LSE):</strong> Last: 95.42, down 3.58 (-3.62%), High: 95.75, Low: 86.75, Volume: 1.08m</div></div><time class=\"marketslive-timestamp o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2017-01-11T11:46:45.000Z\" title=\"Wed Jan 11 2017 11:46:45 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Wed Jan 11 2017 11:46:45 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t11:46 am\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1484135220\" data-mid=\"1359950\" data-rawmessage=\"This wasn&apos;t unexpected, surely\" id=\"webchat-msg-1359950\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">PM</span><span class=\"timestamp\">11:47am</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>This wasn&apos;t unexpected, surely</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1484135231\" data-mid=\"1359951\" data-rawmessage=\"You just have to look in any London estate agents window\" id=\"webchat-msg-1359951\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">PM</span><span class=\"timestamp\">11:47am</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>You just have to look in any London estate agents window</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1484135234\" data-mid=\"1359952\" data-rawmessage=\"Yep.
