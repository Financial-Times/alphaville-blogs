We estimate that the value of exports of Campari from Italy into<br>\nthe US could be EUR25-30m, implying a potential hike of EUR6-7m, which<br>\nis about 1.5% of expected 2019 EBIT. In an interview yesterday, the CEO<br>\nof Campari said that if tariffs were to be applied, Campari would still have<br>\nthe option to move the production of Campari and Aperol to its US plants.<br>\nHence, we do not expect a structural impact on earnings.<br>\nNo impact on R&#xE9;my Cointreau<br>\nWe have flagged R&#xE9;my Cointreau as the company that is most at risk from<br>\nUS import tariffs. The fact that cognac is no longer on the final list of<br>\nproducts, implies that R&#xE9;my Cointreau will not face any negative impact.<br>\nThe company had shipped more products to the US ahead of the possible<br>\nimplementation of tariffs and in preparation for the key Christmas selling<br>\nseason.</p></blockquote>\n</div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">Tax Realist</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTariff impact would only be short lived for Diageo if we leave EU surely?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">marktime</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIndeed, strong wage growth, low inflation, low interest rates, an unloved &#xA3; ... how about a 4 day week on top\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">GBKrona</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t@Tax Realist - many of big Diageo&apos;s brands are actually owned by EU entities (Tax Dodge)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">BornCynic</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThanks BE / ROTR\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">nightingale20201</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t@patience/simple simon (re DS Smith) ...just a reminder CMA is conducting phase 2 of the investigation - https://www.packaging-gateway.com/news/cma-liqui-box-ds-smith/\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><div class=\"msg separator has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1570100494\" data-mid=\"1455535\" data-rawmessage=\"12:01PM\" id=\"webchat-msg-1455535\">\n\t<div class=\"messagebody\"><time class=\"o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2019-10-03T11:01:34.000Z\" title=\"Thu Oct 03 2019 11:01:34 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Thu Oct 03 2019 11:01:34 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tundefined\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time></div></div><time class=\"marketslive-timestamp o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2019-10-03T11:01:45.000Z\" title=\"Thu Oct 03 2019 11:01:45 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Thu Oct 03 2019 11:01:45 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t12:01 pm\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1570100520\" data-mid=\"1455536\" data-rawmessage=\"No time for a Flutter/TSG redux, sorry.\" id=\"webchat-msg-1455536\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">12:02pm</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>No time for a Flutter/TSG redux, sorry.</p>\n</div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">tangledodyssey</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBE, thank you and good afternoon.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">2s10s</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t@BE: cheers (literally)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">marktime</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTrendy whisky the new trendy gin then back to alcopop vodkas\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">2s10s</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t#NegativeRates @ROTR: be careful wishing for negative rates, your pension annuities are priced off the yield curve.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">GBKrona</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthank you @BE.
