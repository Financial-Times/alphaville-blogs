Given time, we believe PFG had the<br>\npotential to achieve the home credit cost reductions itself. But central and borrowing<br>\ncost reductions are additive. The potential for revenue synergies between Vanquis,<br>\nEveryday Loans and NSF Guarantor Loans Division looks compelling, and shorter<br>\nterm crystallization of value in Moneybarn and Satsuma looks attractive.<br>\nOur initial reaction is that NSF / PFG could offer better returns, more quickly, than<br>\nPFG could achieve standalone. However, we see FCA approval of NSF proposals<br>\nas key. e.g. NSF intends to reintroduce ROP at Vanquis, reduce the length of home<br>\ncredit loans and introduce a more flexible operating model including a variable pay<br>\nstructure and flexible working hours for CEMs. These are measures we believe<br>\nPFG would have loved to implement itself, but has so far been unable to do so.</p></blockquote>\n</div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">nightingale20201</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhat is woodford&apos;s endorsement? are they saying that current mgt at PFS is not good enough to turn the ship around and it needs a pair of old hands to fix the prob...etc\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">wayneJ</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWhen do two share holders owning over 50% and thinking something is a good idea become a concert party?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><time class=\"marketslive-timestamp o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2019-02-22T11:47:09.000Z\" title=\"Fri Feb 22 2019 11:47:09 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Fri Feb 22 2019 11:47:09 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t11:47 am\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1550836044\" data-mid=\"1437252\" data-rawmessage=\"ROP is the repayment plan thing on the credit cards that caused Provident to eat a big compensation cost last year.\" id=\"webchat-msg-1437252\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">11:47am</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>ROP is the repayment plan thing on the credit cards that caused Provident to eat a big compensation cost last year.</p>\n</div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">red</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t@nightingale20201yes. its all about execution as i have said many times. its not quite free money. but do things correctly and its a good biz.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">Blank canvas</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThanks for everything today BE - have a good weekend\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1550836090\" data-mid=\"1437253\" data-rawmessage=\"CEMs are Consumer Experience Managers, which is the company&apos;s preferred euphemism for debt collectors.\" id=\"webchat-msg-1437253\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">11:48am</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>CEMs are Consumer Experience Managers, which is the company&apos;s preferred euphemism for debt collectors.</p>\n</div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">red</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttech is fine but here you need to get back to knocking on doors and relationships\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">St Andrean</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t@red - tks re AV.
