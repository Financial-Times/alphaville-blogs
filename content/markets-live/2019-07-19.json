The company attributes this to the US, which was down -1.7% (GSe/cons: -0.5%), which contrasts with OMC&#x2019;s reported +3.2% and a weak performance in Brazil (-20%). However, 1H EBITA margins of 15.0% excl. transaction costs (+60bp yoy) were 30bp ahead of GSe/consensus reflecting greater cost savings and a 20bp benefit from IFRS 16. As a result, FY organic growth guidance was lowered to broadly stable compared to previous guidance of higher organic growth in 2019 vs 2018 (ZoneFinance consensus: 0.9%). Margin expansion is now expected to be at the lower end of the 30-50bp range, given the dilutive impact of Epsilon as well as &#x20AC;20m higher restructuring costs.<br>\nWhile the stock has already underperformed the Stoxx 600 by 16% YTD, we believe these results will be taken negatively by the market given the weaker organic growth and outlook. We also see a slightly negative read across for WPP which is facing similar challenges in its US creative business.</p></blockquote>\n</div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">Tom Dalgleish</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI have friends from Bucaramanga in the east who spoke of it\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1563532778\" data-mid=\"1450508\" data-rawmessage=\"PUB down 8.6% currently ....\" id=\"webchat-msg-1450508\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">11:39am</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>PUB down 8.6% currently ....</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"msg price has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1563532785\" data-mid=\"1450509\" data-rawmessage=\"&lt;strong&gt;WPP PLC (WPP:LSE):&lt;/strong&gt; Last: 909.00, down 28.8 (-3.07%), High: 930.20, Low: 904.00, Volume: 1.82m\" id=\"webchat-msg-1450509\">\n\t<div class=\"messagebody\"><strong>WPP PLC (WPP:LSE):</strong> Last: 909.00, down 28.8 (-3.07%), High: 930.20, Low: 904.00, Volume: 1.82m</div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">nichoman</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tany thoughts / comment on britbox ? not sure they&apos;ll be huge appetite to pay for old british tv when most people can access netflix or amzn at lower cost\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">Greg</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWDI up 6% makes a difference since the past week\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><time class=\"marketslive-timestamp o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2019-07-19T10:40:07.000Z\" title=\"Fri Jul 19 2019 10:40:07 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Fri Jul 19 2019 10:40:07 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t11:40 am\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1563532822\" data-mid=\"1450510\" data-rawmessage=\"And Kepler off the call.\" id=\"webchat-msg-1450510\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">11:40am</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>And Kepler off the call.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"msg blockquote has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1563532827\" data-mid=\"1450511\" data-rawmessage=\"Organic growth back to positive, but only just\nQ2 revenues came in at EUR2,234m, slightly below our forecast of\nEUR2,296m (consensus EUREUR2,247m) due to slightly lower-thanforecast\norganic growth (+0.1% vs +1.3% KECH, +0.7% consensus) and a\nlow level of net M&amp;A (PHS and ProxiMedia were disposed of in H1).\nNorth America again the main problem region\nNorth America was once again the main drag by region, declining -1.7% (vs\nour forecast of flat) as a small number of large FMCG clients continued to\ncut fees, meaning attrition weighed -300bp on organic growth in the\nregion and cEUR50m at a group level in Q2.

But we stayed Overweight on the thesis that better growth would materialise in 2H FY19, driven by EU automation and improvements to the customer proposition in the US (the latter being the key to the  bull  case).  Neither  has  happened &#x2013;rather,they are the  root  cause  of  this warning. Our confidence is therefore significantly  reduced.  On  paper  the  issues  in EU  and  US  should  be  fixable  with  time  given  the  problem  is  inventory-led and not consumer-driven. But we may not seeevidence until cal Q4 at least, and before then we have to get through FY results in Oct. Witha relatively new Chairman and a new CFO,  visibility  is  almost  non-existentas  to  how  they  might  guide  for  FY20E.  We don&#x2019;t  view  the  shares  as  cheap  enough  to  fully  compensate  for  the  risk,so we downgradeto Equal Weight.

Combined with a lack of potential positive catalysts, we think this makes the Ted Baker story the less appealing of the two over the next 12-18 months.Where could we be wrong? Fixing the Superdry brand could take longer than we anticipate, or may not be possible at all. Ted Baker could reaccelerate and concerns around the US environment may be misplaced (bull case 2,600p). Or Ray Kelvin&apos;s resignation may lead to trading weakening further (bear case 400p).</p></blockquote>\n</div></div><div class=\"msg price has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1563534407\" data-mid=\"1450554\" data-rawmessage=\"&lt;strong&gt;Superdry PLC (SDRY:LSE):&lt;/strong&gt; Last: 419.40, up 4.6 (+1.11%), High: 432.00, Low: 416.00, Volume: 94.05k\" id=\"webchat-msg-1450554\">\n\t<div class=\"messagebody\"><strong>Superdry PLC (SDRY:LSE):</strong> Last: 419.40, up 4.6 (+1.11%), High: 432.00, Low: 416.00, Volume: 94.05k</div></div><time class=\"marketslive-timestamp o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2019-07-19T11:06:47.000Z\" title=\"Fri Jul 19 2019 11:06:47 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Fri Jul 19 2019 11:06:47 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t12:06 pm\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time><div class=\"msg price has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1563534422\" data-mid=\"1450555\" data-rawmessage=\"&lt;strong&gt;Ted Baker PLC (TED:LSE):&lt;/strong&gt; Last: 820.50, down 21 (-2.50%), High: 842.00, Low: 816.00, Volume: 77.99k\" id=\"webchat-msg-1450555\">\n\t<div class=\"messagebody\"><strong>Ted Baker PLC (TED:LSE):</strong> Last: 820.50, down 21 (-2.50%), High: 842.00, Low: 816.00, Volume: 77.99k</div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">GBKrona</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tquite a range 400p-2600p  - analyst playing very safe...\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">Tom Dalgleish</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWallette, Excel?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">Excel Developer</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t@Tom: &quot;market share/spend&quot; is P.C.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">GBKrona</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\texcellentte, @Tom D\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">red</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthink superdrys ship has sailed. not sure founder had as much to its success as is believed\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">Tom Dalgleish</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNeither Ted nor SDRY could be LVMH targets, any more than Burberry is?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">Irish HF guy</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t@Excel Developer, you mean wallet is male and purse female, I disagree.
