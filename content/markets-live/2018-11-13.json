The FCF uptick due to confidence on the mid-point of EBITDA and higher contribution from Ziggo should give more confidence on cover. Given positive FX since the summer, there is another tailwind for consensus estimates, currently at &#x20AC;5.1bn. The stable dividend provides support but also shows an acknowledgement that growth is credible only if EBITDA/FCF growth can keep leverage in check, especially in light of the Italian spectrum outlay.</p></blockquote>\n</div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">Dec69 - Skeptic</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t@madrugada I can&apos;t find any reason to own public transport providers.
