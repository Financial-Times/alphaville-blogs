Management has changed its clothing buying approach/ranges for 2H and expects performance to improve as\na result.

In particular, CVAs were slightly worse than expected.&quot; and Our number one priority is to fix the balance sheet. We have a clear plan to do this and are working to make material progress over the next six months. We continue to consider all options to put us in the best position to deal with both our short and medium term liquidity requirements as we approach our next material debt maturity in early 2021. These options include disposing of assets, where we are in the advanced stages of selling two of our Spanish assets, through to raising equity, which is also likely to form part of the solution.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">FATDAZ</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t@AM  there are several groups doing  that ......\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">Irish HF guy</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI must say, INTU trading update was really short this time round, looks like written in a hurry!\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">FATDAZ</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t@fFnaly we had that at BZW in 1987 it was called Girovend\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1573040272\" data-mid=\"1458735\" data-rawmessage=\"Oh, while on it I should mention the FT banking podcast -- we still do those it seeems! -- that talks about push payment fraud and the next wall of compensation claims.\" id=\"webchat-msg-1458735\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">11:37am</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>Oh, while on it I should mention the FT banking podcast -- we still do those it seeems! -- that talks about push payment fraud and the next wall of compensation claims.</p>\n</div></div><time class=\"marketslive-timestamp o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2019-11-06T11:37:40.000Z\" title=\"Wed Nov 06 2019 11:37:40 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Wed Nov 06 2019 11:37:40 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t11:37 am\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1573040275\" data-mid=\"1458736\" data-rawmessage=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ab432baa-136f-47f1-8cc3-8decc4e47bc2\" id=\"webchat-msg-1458736\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">11:37am</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ab432baa-136f-47f1-8cc3-8decc4e47bc2\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.ft.com...-8cc3-8decc4e47bc2</a></p>\n</div></div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1573040303\" data-mid=\"1458737\" data-rawmessage=\"Linked story here for people who prefer reading to listening: https://www.ft.com/content/3c9bc7ba-fbe6-11e9-a354-36acbbb0d9b6\" id=\"webchat-msg-1458737\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">11:38am</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>Linked story here for people who prefer reading to listening: <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3c9bc7ba-fbe6-11e9-a354-36acbbb0d9b6\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.ft.com...-a354-36acbbb0d9b6</a></p>\n</div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">Blank canvas</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFinlay.
