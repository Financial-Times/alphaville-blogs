Nonetheless, we agree that Hammerson is better off on a<br>\nstandalone basis.</p></blockquote>\n</div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">wayneJ</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMy view is that Bloomberg ought to pay a license fee or only have a delayed feed on what Bryce says....\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><time class=\"marketslive-timestamp o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2018-04-19T10:30:13.000Z\" title=\"Thu Apr 19 2018 10:30:13 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Thu Apr 19 2018 10:30:13 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t11:30 am\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1524133828\" data-mid=\"1415390\" data-rawmessage=\"(@Tom Dalgleish: I&apos;m flattered that you consider me benign.)\" id=\"webchat-msg-1415390\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">11:30am</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>(@Tom Dalgleish: I&apos;m flattered that you consider me benign.)</p>\n</div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">Miss Piggy</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t@wayneJ: fair usage though isn&apos;t it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">ftrada</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tanything on essentra?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1524133885\" data-mid=\"1415391\" data-rawmessage=\".... which is a common theme among the sellside.

We expect inflation to trend down further to be back to 2% by the end of 2018.\n\n \n\n&#x201C;Meanwhile, earnings growth has been trending gradually up recently, and this seems likely to continue as a consequence of recruitment difficulties in some sectors and higher inflation fuelling some increased pay awards. Specifically, the latest data shows that regular earnings growth climbed to a two-and-a-half year high of 2.8% in the three months to February. Meanwhile, total weekly earnings growth remained at 2.8% in the three months to February, the highest rate since September 2015.\n\n \n\n&#x201C;Further good news for consumers saw employment rise by 55,000 in the three months to February to reach a new record high of 32.262 million.
