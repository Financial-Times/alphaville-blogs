This was all about the Health business (-1% like for like in the quarter), with IFCN (0%, China slowdown) and the rest of health (-3%, Scholl, Dettol and Durex) coming up short of expectations. The OTC business and Hygiene and Home performed in line with expectations at +1% and +3% respectively.<br>\nGuidance for the full year has been reduced to 2-3% like for like revenue growth from 3-4% reflecting this, albeit the company expects &#x2018;improving trends for H2&#x2019;.  While it&#x2019;s true that the comp for Q3 is undemanding, on current form it seems to us to owe more to hope than expectation.</p>\n<p>This hope seems to be based on Reckitt Benckiser&#x2019;s intention to increase &#x2018;investment in BEI [Brand Equity Investment] and medical marketing to improve growth&#x2019;. This should be music to our ears, but given that there is no change to Reckitt Benckiser&#x2019;s full year operating margin expectations our enthusiasm is limited. It&#x2019;s true that 1H&#x2019;s operating margin was 40bps ahead of consensus, but we&#x2019;d be surprised if this is enough to turn around Reckitt Benckiser&#x2019;s revenue performance in a sustainable way.</p>\n<p>This is all less interesting than it would normally be, with new CEO Laxman Narasimhan due to take control in a just over a month. We think he&#x2019;s been presented with a great opportunity to revive Reckitt&#x2019;s sales growth but this will require significant investment.

I think the Board will definitely want to come back to dividend&quot;, management said.2. Buyback to accelerate in 2H too: &quot;We&apos;ve also got somewhere close to $1.8 billion of buybacks to come in the second half of this year that will offset the scrip since the third quarter of 2017.&quot;3. Confident in $4-5bn disposals in 2019: &quot;We&apos;re pretty confident in terms of the disposal program.

We&apos;re just going to remain very disciplined within our capital framework. We haven&apos;t made a decision yet [but] we&apos;re going to be really, really careful before we leap into that.&quot;\" id=\"webchat-msg-1451421\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">12:17pm</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><blockquote><p>1. Upside to dividend in 2H: &quot;We are more than well underpinned on the cash flow targets we laid out to 2021. That will give us a great confidence in terms of any move or look at distribution [...] As you see [the balance sheet] de-leverage, that will be a signal in terms of distributions and a move on the dividend later in the second half of this year. I think the Board will definitely want to come back to dividend&quot;, management said.2. Buyback to accelerate in 2H too: &quot;We&apos;ve also got somewhere close to $1.8 billion of buybacks to come in the second half of this year that will offset the scrip since the third quarter of 2017.&quot;3. Confident in $4-5bn disposals in 2019: &quot;We&apos;re pretty confident in terms of the disposal program. It&apos;s just taking longer; there is more private equity involved in some of those low 48 assets [...] We&apos;re still seeing a pretty good suites of buyers for the assets that we have for-sale.&quot;4. Gearing to fall ~600bp by end-2020: &quot;We expect gearing to trend down through the second half of the year, back into the 27% range [from 31% at the end of 2Q19]. [After that, ] we continue to expect gearing to move towards the middle of our targeted range of 20% to 30% through 2020.&quot;5. Expansion into low-carbon businesses accelerating: &quot;I also want to talk about the focus we&apos;re giving to the energy transition and our low carbon agenda. All of these businesses are central to our growth agenda into the next decade and beyond and core to the integrated global energy business we are continuing to shape.&quot;6. Gulf of Mexico payments to fall sharply: &quot;Pretty much all the BEL claims [ie Business Economic Loss claims] are done [...] We said [GoM payments would be] just around $2 billion for this year, but we&apos;re pretty much [done given the payments in 1H19]&quot;.7. Slow ramp-up in the Permian, dependent on pipeline capacity: &quot;In terms of Permian, it will be slow progress through this year, as we make sure that the evacuation routes are available. The midstream is going be a really big important part of that.&quot;8. IMO 2020 to support refining margins by year-end: &quot;Refining margins are expected to see support with the implementation of IMO 2020, which should also contribute to increase widening of light to heavy crude differentials&quot;.9. Careful about &apos;Transfer of Rights&apos; area in Brazil: &quot;The &apos;Transfer of Rights&apos; [area in Brazil] looks very expensive. We&apos;re just going to remain very disciplined within our capital framework. We haven&apos;t made a decision yet [but] we&apos;re going to be really, really careful before we leap into that.&quot;</p></blockquote>\n</div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">Excel Developer</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t@Irish HF: cheers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">Viking1</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHave a good afternoon, thanks BE\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1564485466\" data-mid=\"1451422\" data-rawmessage=\"And Barclays saying &quot;ship it on board, ****&quot;\" id=\"webchat-msg-1451422\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">12:17pm</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>And Barclays saying &quot;ship it on board, ****&quot;</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1564485487\" data-mid=\"1451423\" data-rawmessage=\"(No one below the age of 40 will get the reference, I guess.)\" id=\"webchat-msg-1451423\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">12:18pm</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>(No one below the age of 40 will get the reference, I guess.)</p>\n</div></div><time class=\"marketslive-timestamp o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2019-07-30T11:17:58.000Z\" title=\"Tue Jul 30 2019 11:17:58 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Tue Jul 30 2019 11:17:58 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t12:17 pm\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time><div class=\"msg blockquote has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1564485493\" data-mid=\"1451424\" data-rawmessage=\"the  half  way pointof itsfive-year  strategy  planBP  appears  to  be  well  on  track. 2019 was neverset tobe a spectacular year given heavy maintenance and disposals, but both  earnings  and  cashflow  have  so  far  proved  surprisingly  resilient.
