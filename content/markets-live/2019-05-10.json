It is also possible that the political fallout from the actions taken today will force the US, China or both to step back from further negotiations for a time. Such a delay would increase uncertainty with negative consequences for both economies and financial markets.<br>\nIt is also possible that this case could produce a deal that is narrower in scope that what had seemed to be on the table, possibly making it easier to achieve but with fewer benefits. It is also possible that a restart to negotiations could lead to an agreement that is broader in scope with more benefits. That would likely take more time, however, and the potential benefits of widening the negotiations would likely not be evident for some time.<br>\nWorst case scenario &#x2013; protracted breakdown in negotiations<br>\nAs noted above, the breakdown that occurred over the last week may reflect a wider gap between the two sides than was evident before. One possibility is that this break reflects a broad-based shift across the US government to seeing China as a strategic competitor that needs to be confronted more forcefully. Moreover, the escalation of the dispute may generate its own political dynamics that make it difficult for the two sides to continue negotiations.<br>\nIn this case, effective negotiations may break down more or less permanently. Both sides have previously said they are prepared to accept the economic consequences of such a breach.</p></blockquote>\n</div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">PBateman</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tkept juncker away from the cameras... hehe\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><time class=\"marketslive-timestamp o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2019-05-10T10:21:23.000Z\" title=\"Fri May 10 2019 10:21:23 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Fri May 10 2019 10:21:23 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t11:21 am\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time><div class=\"msg blockquote has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1557483698\" data-mid=\"1444299\" data-rawmessage=\"How things could evolve from here\nThe next steps will depend on how governments, financial markets and the broader economy respond, as well as the domestic political reaction in each country.
