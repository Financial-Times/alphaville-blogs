This is little acceleration vs 2H18 when the reported number was &#xA3;479. It also comes in below our estimate of &#xA3;675. The company flags the US as the headwind, reflecting the unwinding of high year-end 2018 trade inventories following the restocking of Vibe and low first quarter trade demand due to regulatory uncertainty in the US. While we know this dynamic in the US is true, and Alto market share trends are encouraging (offtake ml share at 8.3% YTD compared to 6.9% in February), what is more likely to worry, given how accretive it is to sales, is Glo market share in Japan. This was at 5% YTD and compares to 5.1% in February, suggesting share trends have stalled completely, or in fact, continued to increase for a period and are now in reverse. The company says RRP revenue growth is expected to accelerate in H2, driven by the timing of new and enhanced product launches, leading to FY growth around the middle of their 30&#x2010;50% guidance range.

The fact that cigarette volume share is down 10bps YTD is, therefore, likely to cause some concern.</p>\n<p>2) RRP delivery and guidance disappointing: Of particular concern will likely be the 1H19 guided number, the company suggesting RRP sales could come in around &#xA3;520mn (approaching growth of 30%). This is little acceleration vs 2H18 when the reported number was &#xA3;479. It also comes in below our estimate of &#xA3;675. The company flags the US as the headwind, reflecting the unwinding of high year-end 2018 trade inventories following the restocking of Vibe and low first quarter trade demand due to regulatory uncertainty in the US. While we know this dynamic in the US is true, and Alto market share trends are encouraging (offtake ml share at 8.3% YTD compared to 6.9% in February), what is more likely to worry, given how accretive it is to sales, is Glo market share in Japan. This was at 5% YTD and compares to 5.1% in February, suggesting share trends have stalled completely, or in fact, continued to increase for a period and are now in reverse.
