We believe this would provide a better see-through value and moreover would provide a clearer vehicle through which the group could pursue tower acquisitions or mergers<br>\n&#xF0B7; We would expect Vodafone to announce some selective, small scale, tower disposals in the coming quarters prior to the formation of this entity<br>\n&#xF0B7; Vodafone is also likely to continue announcing both active and passive tower sharing deals in the meantime, with this helping to accelerate the group&#x2019;s 5G network build, whilst also offering substantial opex and capex synergies.<br>\n&#xF0B7; Whilst the proceeds of tower sales will helpfully support group deleveraging, we actually think the key attraction of this deal will be to unlock the &quot;hidden&quot; value within Vodafone&apos;s heavily depressed share price. Note that our SoTP based valuation offers 67% upside, highlighting the deep value presented by the group&#x2019;s shares.</p></blockquote>\n</div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">Excel Developer</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t&quot;5G Will Go Rural But With Less CapacityThe multi-gigabit speeds and massive capacity you hear about with 5G is by and large an urban phenomenon, driven by the huge bandwidths of millimeter-wave spectrum, which doesn&apos;t travel very far.

Whilst group level KPIs were broadly in-line (although membership slightly weak offset by ARPA) we see the accelerating decline in agency membership (-560 in 1H19 vs &#x2013;257 in 2H18) as an increasing problem.
