Ongoing very low mortgage interest rates should also help the housing market.</p></blockquote>\n</div></div><div class=\"msg separator has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1494929700\" data-mid=\"1377453\" data-rawmessage=\"11:14AM\" id=\"webchat-msg-1377453\">\n\t<div class=\"messagebody\"><time class=\"o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2017-05-16T10:15:00.000Z\" title=\"Tue May 16 2017 10:15:00 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Tue May 16 2017 10:15:00 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tundefined\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time></div></div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1494929714\" data-mid=\"1377454\" data-rawmessage=\"Speaking of airlines and/or sandwiches .....\" id=\"webchat-msg-1377454\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-2\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">11:15am</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>Speaking of airlines and/or sandwiches .....</p>\n</div></div><time class=\"marketslive-timestamp o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2017-05-16T10:15:06.000Z\" title=\"Tue May 16 2017 10:15:06 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Tue May 16 2017 10:15:06 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t11:15 am\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time><div class=\"msg price has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1494929721\" data-mid=\"1377455\" data-rawmessage=\"&lt;strong&gt;easyJet plc (EZJ:LSE):&lt;/strong&gt; Last: 1,243, down 67 (-5.11%), High: 1,271, Low: 1,221, Volume: 3.49m\" id=\"webchat-msg-1377455\">\n\t<div class=\"messagebody\"><strong>easyJet plc (EZJ:LSE):</strong> Last: 1,243, down 67 (-5.11%), High: 1,271, Low: 1,221, Volume: 3.49m</div></div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1494929747\" data-mid=\"1377456\" data-rawmessage=\"It does both, of course, and makes better margin on the latter than the former.\" id=\"webchat-msg-1377456\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-2\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">11:15am</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>It does both, of course, and makes better margin on the latter than the former.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1494929780\" data-mid=\"1377457\" data-rawmessage=\"H1 shows pricing still under pressure, which is somewhat contrary to the inflation data.\" id=\"webchat-msg-1377457\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-2\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">11:16am</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>H1 shows pricing still under pressure, which is somewhat contrary to the inflation data.</p>\n</div></div><time class=\"marketslive-timestamp o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2017-05-16T10:16:32.000Z\" title=\"Tue May 16 2017 10:16:32 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Tue May 16 2017 10:16:32 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t11:16 am\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1494929807\" data-mid=\"1377458\" data-rawmessage=\"H1 underlying loss before tax of &#xA3;212m, which is worse than a consensus of &#xA3;200m-ish.\" id=\"webchat-msg-1377458\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-2\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">11:16am</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>H1 underlying loss before tax of &#xA3;212m, which is worse than a consensus of &#xA3;200m-ish.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1494929840\" data-mid=\"1377459\" data-rawmessage=\"Yields weak even excluding the Easter timing thing.\" id=\"webchat-msg-1377459\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-2\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">11:17am</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>Yields weak even excluding the Easter timing thing.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1494929877\" data-mid=\"1377460\" data-rawmessage=\"Guidance uninspiring.
