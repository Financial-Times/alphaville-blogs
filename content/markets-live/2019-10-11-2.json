This has raised fears that WPP will also see worsening trends in Q3. However, we think Publicis&#x2019; problems are more firm specific than anything else despite the claims from the group that general industry trends were at the room of its problems. Of the four reasons we identified for Publicis&#x2019; weakness, only one really applies to WPP (with one a partial read-across)\n\n1. Publicis has bitten off more than it can chew &#x2013; PUBLICIS SPECIFIC. The history of Publicis in recent years has been major acquisitions (Sapient, Epsilon etc.) that require major integration efforts and can lead management to take its eyes off the ball on the running of the core business.\n\n2. Despite these deals, which were supposed to fuel organic revenue growth &#x2013; PUBLICIS SPECIFIC. Publicis lags its peers at the top-line. That suggests these assets may not be as high quality as portrayed (indeed Epsilon looks to be declining low single digit organically judging from the comments on the call);\n\n3. Concentration of clients &#x2013; MORE PUBLICIS SPECIFIC. 34% of Publicis&#x2019; revenues comes from its top 30 clients. WPP has 14% from its top 10 clients. There is no like for like comparable here but our suspicion is that Publicis&#x2019; top 10 clients is probably more like 20%+ (historically, Publicis was more concentrated).
