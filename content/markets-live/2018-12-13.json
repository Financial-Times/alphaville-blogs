The downgrade overshadowed a trading update from the defence technology group confirming that performance was in line with expectations.\n\nAnalysis of Ultra&#x2019;s accounts over the past five years showed underlying profits included low-quality items while excluding significant costs, said Barclays. Its team also questioned Ultra&#x2019;s acquisition record, highlighting regular impairment losses and a lack of evidence that earn-out targets were ever met.  \n\nUnderlying operating profit and cash flow have been consistently higher than operating profit under GAAP accounting standards, said the broker, which criticised Ultra&#x2019;s historic treatment of currency effects, dividends from associates and non-cash gains from provision releases. Barclays also criticised the group&#x2019;s &#x201C;general lack of clarity&#x201D; regarding acquisition and disposal-related payments, which it said were not included in underlying metrics and not reference elsewhere in financial statements.\n\nAdded to that, Barclays called Ultra&#x2019;s cash conversion &#x201C;concerning&#x201D; at just 78 per cent on average between 2013 and 2017. Increasing working capital demands have meant that net receivables grew six times faster than operating profits over the period, it said. But new IFRS 15 accounting rules defer the company&#x2019;s revenue recognition, which combined with a depleted reserve of provisions and reduced acquisition activity means Ultra will have to rebase its sector-leading profit margins, said the broker.\" id=\"webchat-msg-1432956\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">11:47am</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><blockquote><p>Barclays cut Ultra Electronics Holdings to &#x201C;underweight&#x201D; from &#x201C;equal weight&#x201D; with a &#xA3;11.20 target price. The downgrade overshadowed a trading update from the defence technology group confirming that performance was in line with expectations.</p>\n<p>Analysis of Ultra&#x2019;s accounts over the past five years showed underlying profits included low-quality items while excluding significant costs, said Barclays. Its team also questioned Ultra&#x2019;s acquisition record, highlighting regular impairment losses and a lack of evidence that earn-out targets were ever met.  </p>\n<p>Underlying operating profit and cash flow have been consistently higher than operating profit under GAAP accounting standards, said the broker, which criticised Ultra&#x2019;s historic treatment of currency effects, dividends from associates and non-cash gains from provision releases. Barclays also criticised the group&#x2019;s &#x201C;general lack of clarity&#x201D; regarding acquisition and disposal-related payments, which it said were not included in underlying metrics and not reference elsewhere in financial statements.</p>\n<p>Added to that, Barclays called Ultra&#x2019;s cash conversion &#x201C;concerning&#x201D; at just 78 per cent on average between 2013 and 2017. Increasing working capital demands have meant that net receivables grew six times faster than operating profits over the period, it said. But new IFRS 15 accounting rules defer the company&#x2019;s revenue recognition, which combined with a depleted reserve of provisions and reduced acquisition activity means Ultra will have to rebase its sector-leading profit margins, said the broker.</p></blockquote>\n</div></div><time class=\"marketslive-timestamp o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2018-12-13T11:48:01.000Z\" title=\"Thu Dec 13 2018 11:48:01 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Thu Dec 13 2018 11:48:01 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t11:48 am\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1544701696\" data-mid=\"1432957\" data-rawmessage=\"That&apos;s what you&apos;ll get to read later, over here, eventually: https://www.ft.com/stocks-to-watch\" id=\"webchat-msg-1432957\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">11:48am</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>That&apos;s what you&apos;ll get to read later, over here, eventually: <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stocks-to-watch\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.ft.com/stocks-to-watch</a></p>\n</div></div><div class=\"msg separator has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1544701702\" data-mid=\"1432958\" data-rawmessage=\"11:48AM\" id=\"webchat-msg-1432958\">\n\t<div class=\"messagebody\"><time class=\"o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2018-12-13T11:48:22.000Z\" title=\"Thu Dec 13 2018 11:48:22 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Thu Dec 13 2018 11:48:22 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tundefined\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time></div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">Soundbuy</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tElementis if you&apos;ve time (or grey)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">Tom Dalgleish</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAustralian PURP sicker than that\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">red</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tecb day today, draghi often displays dovish tint. more likely today given softening of recent data.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">nichoman</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t@Irish HF - thanks, interesting take\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1544701801\" data-mid=\"1432959\" data-rawmessage=\"Comments a bit slow today.
