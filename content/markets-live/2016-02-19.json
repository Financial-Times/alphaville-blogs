Segro shares have been resilient during a turbulent start\nto the year for the real estate sector, up 1%, outperforming the sector by 13%.\nIncome-focused companies and those with exposure to industrial/distribution\nproperty have performed well, and we expect Segro to continue to benefit from\nthis improved sentiment given the late-cycle growth characteristics of the asset\nclass and the structural demand for logistics space driven by changing\nconsumer behaviour.\nNAV 463p, up 21% over the year, ahead of our forecast of 445p, driven by\n11.1% capital growth in the like-for-like investment portfolio. The UK portfolio\nvaluation was up 13.1%, outperforming Europe which was up 7.9%. Yield\ncompression was a significant driver of capital growth, though rental growth\nhas risen compared to the year before and is becoming a more important\ncomponent of valuation improvements. In the UK, the average yield fell 30bps\nand rental growth was 4.4%. In Europe, yields fell 100bps and rental values\nfell 0.9%. Much of the fall in rental values was in Central Europe in the first\nhalf, with the second half stable, and management commented that there are\npressures growing on rental values across Europe.\nEPS 18.4p, up 7% and ahead of our forecast of 17.8p, as the company\nreturned to earnings growth following the completion of its restructuring\nprogramme in 2014. The rise in earnings was driven by a 4.2% increase in net\nrental income (UK +5.2%, Europe +1.2%) and a fall in vacancy to a record low\nof 4.8% (down from 6.3%). We believe the fall in vacancy demonstrates the\nstrong occupier demand for industrial assets. DPS 15.6p, up 3.3%, close to\nour forecast of 15.5p.\nOffice disposals. Post year-end, Segro disposed of its offices at Bath Road\nfor &#xA3;325m. Though this reduces rental income, we believe the company can\nrecoup this with deployment of the capital into its development programme and\nacquisitions. We interpret the increase in the dividend ahead of expectations\nas a signal as to management&apos;s confidence in future earnings growth.\nDevelopments. In strong occupier markets the company has been able to\ncommence more speculative developments, with a pipeline capable of\ndelivering &#xA3;109m of new rental income, which is equivalent to 38% of the\ncompany&apos;s current income stream.\" id=\"webchat-msg-1314348\"><span class=\"messageheader par color-1\" title=\"11:39\">BE</span><div class=\"messagebody\"><blockquote><p>Valuation &amp; rating. Segro shares have been resilient during a turbulent start<br>\nto the year for the real estate sector, up 1%, outperforming the sector by 13%.<br>\nIncome-focused companies and those with exposure to industrial/distribution<br>\nproperty have performed well, and we expect Segro to continue to benefit from<br>\nthis improved sentiment given the late-cycle growth characteristics of the asset<br>\nclass and the structural demand for logistics space driven by changing<br>\nconsumer behaviour.<br>\nNAV 463p, up 21% over the year, ahead of our forecast of 445p, driven by<br>\n11.1% capital growth in the like-for-like investment portfolio. The UK portfolio<br>\nvaluation was up 13.1%, outperforming Europe which was up 7.9%. Yield<br>\ncompression was a significant driver of capital growth, though rental growth<br>\nhas risen compared to the year before and is becoming a more important<br>\ncomponent of valuation improvements. In the UK, the average yield fell 30bps<br>\nand rental growth was 4.4%. In Europe, yields fell 100bps and rental values<br>\nfell 0.9%. Much of the fall in rental values was in Central Europe in the first<br>\nhalf, with the second half stable, and management commented that there are<br>\npressures growing on rental values across Europe.<br>\nEPS 18.4p, up 7% and ahead of our forecast of 17.8p, as the company<br>\nreturned to earnings growth following the completion of its restructuring<br>\nprogramme in 2014. The rise in earnings was driven by a 4.2% increase in net<br>\nrental income (UK +5.2%, Europe +1.2%) and a fall in vacancy to a record low<br>\nof 4.8% (down from 6.3%). We believe the fall in vacancy demonstrates the<br>\nstrong occupier demand for industrial assets. DPS 15.6p, up 3.3%, close to<br>\nour forecast of 15.5p.<br>\nOffice disposals. Post year-end, Segro disposed of its offices at Bath Road<br>\nfor &#xA3;325m. Though this reduces rental income, we believe the company can<br>\nrecoup this with deployment of the capital into its development programme and<br>\nacquisitions. We interpret the increase in the dividend ahead of expectations<br>\nas a signal as to management&apos;s confidence in future earnings growth.<br>\nDevelopments.
