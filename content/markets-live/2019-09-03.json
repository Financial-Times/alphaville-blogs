It is also important to put into context that these results were delivered despite input cost headwinds of &#xA3;10.8m during the period, which is testament to management and how they have re-engineered this business during what has been a complex restructuring since 2017.<br>\n&#x25AA; Progress delivered: The heavy lifting of the turnaround is now complete and has been very well executed in an unhelpful FX environment following further sterling pressure given Brexit uncertainty. The business is now more operationally efficient and fit for purpose, while the Group is beginning to secure more enhanced credit terms from its key suppliers. The Group is expected to remain innovative in winning new business, and capitalise from its low cost, high service &#x201C;brand killer&#x201D; approach to different products and markets. Looking further ahead, the Group is exploring opportunities to grow the business and de-risk its exposure to FX and tissue price volatility, which remains at the macro level.</p></blockquote>\n</div></div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1567507981\" data-mid=\"1452811\" data-rawmessage=\"&quot;Low cost, high service &apos;brand killer&apos; approach&quot; ... blimey.\" id=\"webchat-msg-1452811\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">11:53am</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>&quot;Low cost, high service &apos;brand killer&apos; approach&quot; ... blimey.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"msg blockquote has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1567508004\" data-mid=\"1452812\" data-rawmessage=\"Forecasts: Guidance remains unchanged from the Trading Update in June, and we are maintaining our forecasts as a result.
