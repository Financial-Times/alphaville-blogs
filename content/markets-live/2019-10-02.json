Even if we assume a benign Brexit outcome (say, a disruptive exit per the BoE scenario as communicated to HMT on 3rd September at worst) we are NEGATIVE on the outlook for traditional mainstream UK banks (i.e., MTRO&#x2019;s principal competitors) for a multitude of reasons: i) lacklustre economic growth (at best) causing loan growth and revenue growth challenges; ii) lower for longer, driving material NIM erosion (mortgage pricing pressure despite recent welcome uplift in spreads which has compressed a little since early September, deposit lower bound issues, structural hedge income decay as the swaps roll), stimulating revenue decline; iii) fee income growth challenges; iv) cost reduction difficulties in the absence of material further restructuring spend &#x2013; and simultaneous need for continued investment spend (and let&#x2019;s not forget that if a bank is operating at a 50% Cost/Income ratio it needs to deliver 2% cost reduction for every 1% reduction in revenues to maintain absolute levels of profitability, which is not without its challenges); and v) substantive inflation in capital requirements owing to the finalised Basel III reforms package measures, which we believe investors will frontload in returns / capital adequacy assessments once more clarity on quantum emerges (though we accept there are some potential mitigants like CCyB reduction, software intangibles inclusion in CET1 capital, and credit insurance)*.
