Visibility for the full year is net growth capex of &#xA3;280m on 260 locations and 7.5m sq ft of space, higher than prior guidance of<br>\nnet growth capex of &#xA3;260m on 250 locations and 7.0m sq ft of space.<br>\nNetwork rationalisation. The group has rationalised c.4% of the network in the nine months to 30 September 2019. This impacts near-term profitability (by &#xA3;27.9m YTD), but will deliver improved returns and value creation in the future. This focus is expected to continue in 4Q19 and early 2020.<br>\nProgress on franchising. Following the master franchise agreements in Japan, Taiwan and Switzerland, in total the group has 27 franchise partners across 22 countries, with combined commitments of over 400 new centre locations. The group anticipates reporting on further deals in the future to continue to unlock value for shareholders.<br>\nGroup net debt at 30 September on a pre-IFRS 16 basis was &#xA3;301.2m (vs &#xA3;298.1m at 1H), representing leverage of 0.8x, the lower-end of the 0.75x-1.5x target range.<br>\nOutlook. The group remains very confident in the structural, long-term growth in the flexible workspace market and IWG&apos;s leading place within it. The group continues to invest in its leading global platform and management to support the strategy and looks forward to the rest of the year with confidence.</p></blockquote>\n</div></div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1572954185\" data-mid=\"1458587\" data-rawmessage=\"They&apos;re pro.\" id=\"webchat-msg-1458587\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">11:43am</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>They&apos;re pro.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"msg blockquote has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1572954199\" data-mid=\"1458588\" data-rawmessage=\"Momentum continues to build in franchising, as highlighted by the Switzerland deal announced yesterday.

The recent increase in remote gaming duty was designed to offset the reduction in tax revenue from the reduction in maximum stakes on land-based B2 content (FOBTs) to &#xA3;2. It is hard to see how tax revenue from a reduction in online stakes could be replaced. If the government were prepared to look past this, we think the companies themselves are well placed to mitigate much of the financial impact through increased customer recycling, changes in return to player percentages and reductions in marketing spend (which is fundamentally ROI driven).\nHowever, from an APPG objective, the likelihood is that none of this reduces player harm.\nThose players that want to stake higher amounts will simply migrate to unlicenced, offshore sites with all the potential risks that entails.
