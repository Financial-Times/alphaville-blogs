ITV has reiterated its &#xA3;1.1bn spend for the year. This drove the c&#xA3;20m beat in Broadcast. Studios EBITA also beat by &#xA3;11m although the FY outlook is in line with expectations. (i) H1 advertising was down 5% (MSe - 6%): Total ITV advertising declined 7% in Q1 2019. ITV had predicted April up 8%, May -2% and June down 20%. In the end April was up 8%, May down 3% and June down 11 % with June much better than expected.Looking forward ITV has July down 5%, August up 2% and September at flat to up 5%. This implies that Q3 will be in the range of -1% to +1%. We had -5% in July, -2% in August and flat for September bringing Q3 to -2% and 9m to -5%. ITV thinks that it will be at around -3% after 9 months. We are at -3.9% for the year.

The  interim  dividend  was  +3.9%  YoY,  ahead  of  the  EPS  decline  of  -2%.
