The survey showed an acceleration of what is being called a youth e-cigarette epidemic where 27.5% of high school students used e-cigarettes in the past 30 days. Interestingly, tobacco use continues to decline among high schoolers down to a new low of 5.8%, which brings into question the &apos;e-cigarettes are a gateway to tobacco use&apos; thesis. This thesis will be tested as the FDA restricts the e-cigarette category. We expect some of these e-cigarette users to experiment with other flavoured tobacco products on the market like menthol cigarettes and potentially IQOS, thus helping the tobacco companies. The time frame for this ban could be &apos;several weeks&apos; to put forth a plan, followed by a 30 day implementation period. It could be relatively speedy because the FDA is simply ending its enforcement discretion - in other words, the Obama era rules allowed e-cigarettes on the market at the FDA&apos;s discretion and the FDA has the ability to pull flavours. It seems that the FDA can pull these products off the market without a rulemaking process. Scott Gottlieb described banning flavours as the easier option from a legal perspective.. Tobacco flavoured e-cigarettes will remain on the market until May 2020, though that day might move forward. It is unclear how much the tobacco industry will even fight this legislation because it will probably help the sales of far more profitable cigarettes. We were surprised that the FDA didn&apos;t simply ban JUUL but if the FDA wants to ding them for this youth epidemic, they will not allow them to pass the May 2020 PMTA hurdle because of this youth issue. All e-cig manufacturers will need to demonstrate there is a net benefit to society from being on the market to clear PMTA. This hurdle is important because it should significantly reduce competition in e-cigarettes, thus helping the profitability of these products. We see this as more of a positive for BAT though we would like to see them file their PMTA for glo. While it is still positive for Imperial Brands, Imperial over-indexes to the vapour category vs its peers, so there is a case to be made that they do not benefit as much. Incidentally, this flavoured e-cig ban will probably have a negative impact on Imperial&apos;s LTIPs.
