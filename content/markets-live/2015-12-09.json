With the iron ore<br>\nprice hitting new lows, and abundant negative sentiment, further share price downside<br>\nis a possibility in the short-term. While we will review our commodity and exchange rate<br>\nassumptions in January, reflecting recent price weakness, we remain confident of the<br>\nlonger term potential for the company, and maintain our BUY rating.</p></blockquote>\n</div></div>\n\n<div class=\"msg separator has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1449660382\" data-mid=\"1303996\" data-rawmessage=\"11:26AM\" id=\"webchat-msg-1303996\"><div class=\"messagebody\"><time class=\"o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2015-12-09T11:26:22.000Z\" title=\"Wed Dec 09 2015 11:26:22 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Wed Dec 09 2015 11:26:22 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tundefined\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time></div></div>\n\n<div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1449660415\" data-mid=\"1303997\" data-rawmessage=\"And so to profit warnings.\" id=\"webchat-msg-1303997\"><span class=\"messageheader par color-1\" title=\"11:26\">BE</span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>And so to profit warnings.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n<time class=\"marketslive-timestamp o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2015-12-09T11:26:47.000Z\" title=\"Wed Dec 09 2015 11:26:47 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Wed Dec 09 2015 11:26:47 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t11:26 am\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time><div class=\"msg price has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1449660422\" data-mid=\"1303998\" data-rawmessage=\"&lt;strong&gt;Stagecoach Group PLC (SGC:LSE):&lt;/strong&gt; Last: 306.70, down 49.4 (-13.87%), High: 342.00, Low: 295.10, Volume: 1.61m\" id=\"webchat-msg-1303998\"><div class=\"messagebody\"><strong>Stagecoach Group PLC (SGC:LSE):</strong> Last: 306.70, down 49.4 (-13.87%), High: 342.00, Low: 295.10, Volume: 1.61m</div></div>\n\n<div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1449660436\" data-mid=\"1303999\" data-rawmessage=\"People aren&apos;t taking the bus due to Isis.\" id=\"webchat-msg-1303999\"><span class=\"messageheader par color-1\" title=\"11:27\">BE</span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>People aren&apos;t taking the bus due to Isis.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n<div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1449660441\" data-mid=\"1304000\" data-rawmessage=\"That&apos;s the gist of it.\" id=\"webchat-msg-1304000\"><span class=\"messageheader par color-1\" title=\"11:27\">BE</span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>That&apos;s the gist of it.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n<time class=\"marketslive-timestamp o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2015-12-09T11:27:28.000Z\" title=\"Wed Dec 09 2015 11:27:28 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Wed Dec 09 2015 11:27:28 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t11:27 am\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1449660463\" data-mid=\"1304001\" data-rawmessage=\"Consensus comes down 6%\" id=\"webchat-msg-1304001\"><span class=\"messageheader par color-1\" title=\"11:27\">BE</span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>Consensus comes down 6%</p>\n</div></div>\n\n<div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1449660491\" data-mid=\"1304002\" data-rawmessage=\"More importantly, perhaps, the possibility of a special div disappears.\" id=\"webchat-msg-1304002\"><span class=\"messageheader par color-1\" title=\"11:28\">BE</span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>More importantly, perhaps, the possibility of a special div disappears.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n<div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1449660537\" data-mid=\"1304003\" data-rawmessage=\"Morgan Stanley can summarise it, to save my typing.\" id=\"webchat-msg-1304003\"><span class=\"messageheader par color-1\" title=\"11:28\">BE</span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>Morgan Stanley can summarise it, to save my typing.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n<time class=\"marketslive-timestamp o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2015-12-09T11:28:48.000Z\" title=\"Wed Dec 09 2015 11:28:48 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Wed Dec 09 2015 11:28:48 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t11:28 am\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time><div class=\"msg blockquote has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1449660543\" data-mid=\"1304004\" data-rawmessage=\"Stagecoach reports 1H 2016 EPS of 17.0p, which compares to MSe of 17.3p,\nand a group EBITA of &#xA3;144.6m vs. MSe &#xA3;142m, driven by solid performance in\nUK Rail.
