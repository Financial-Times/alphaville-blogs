while property activity stayed resilient\n\nAfter its strong rebound in March, China&#x2019;s growth momentum in April slowed more than expected. Weakness in exports, retail sales and corporate CAPEX weighed on industrial production. Some one-off factors should have played a role, including the shock from the VAT cut on industrial production, difference in holiday dates on retail sales, and high base effect on exports. That said, the growth momentum seems still weak even after controlling for the above distortive factors.
