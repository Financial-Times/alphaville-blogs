Daily wagers were 4% ahead in cc, adjusting<br>\nfor Euro 2016, and underlying wager growth in cc was 8%, prompted by the new bwin<br>\nmarketing campaign launched in August.<br>\n&#x25CF; Daily NGR for games brands increased by 15% (17% in cc) over the same period last year. NGR<br>\nfor partypoker grew by 48% yoy, thanks to product improvement and increased marketing<br>\ninvestment. NGR for casino brands also grew in Q3, while bingo returned to underlying<br>\ngrowth during the period.<br>\n&#x25CF; On current consensus estimates, which we do not think will move today, single-digit growth<br>\nis expected for Q4 (we forecast +7% yoy on a reported basis), which seems conservative at<br>\nthis stage (the company has stated that Q4 started strong).<br>\n&#x25CF; We expect the stock to be strongly up today. Also, we flag that top-line growth in Q4 and<br>\n2018-19 is likely to be higher than what currently consensus is factoring in. We keep GVC as<br>\nour top pick in gaming, thanks to underlying growth opportunities and potential for valueaccretive M&amp;A.<br>\n&#x25CF; We value the stock with a DCF method (10% WACC, 2% perpetual growth).</p></blockquote>\n</div></div><time class=\"marketslive-timestamp o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2017-10-12T11:03:47.000Z\" title=\"Thu Oct 12 2017 11:03:47 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Thu Oct 12 2017 11:03:47 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t12:03 pm\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1507806242\" data-mid=\"1395900\" data-rawmessage=\"@Helen78: that&apos;s a very good question.\" id=\"webchat-msg-1395900\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">12:04pm</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>@Helen78: that&apos;s a very good question.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1507806282\" data-mid=\"1395901\" data-rawmessage=\"A reminder that Turkey is GVC&apos;s second-biggest market by sales.\" id=\"webchat-msg-1395901\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">12:04pm</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>A reminder that Turkey is GVC&apos;s second-biggest market by sales.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1507806332\" data-mid=\"1395902\" data-rawmessage=\"https://i.imgur.com/KfIh4jA.png\" id=\"webchat-msg-1395902\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">12:05pm</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p><img class=\"picture\" src=\"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2F__origami%2Fservice%2Fimage%2Fv2%2Fimages%2Fraw%2Fhttps%253A%252F%252Fi.imgur.com%252FKfIh4jA.png%3Fsource%3DAlphaville%26width%3D675%26fit%3Dscale-down?source=Alphaville\"></p>\n</div></div><time class=\"marketslive-timestamp o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2017-10-12T11:06:05.000Z\" title=\"Thu Oct 12 2017 11:06:05 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Thu Oct 12 2017 11:06:05 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t12:06 pm\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1507806380\" data-mid=\"1395903\" data-rawmessage=\"And 32% of revenues are from markets not regulated or in the process of being regulated, to use GVC&apos;s definition.\" id=\"webchat-msg-1395903\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">12:06pm</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>And 32% of revenues are from markets not regulated or in the process of being regulated, to use GVC&apos;s definition.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"msg separator has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1507806437\" data-mid=\"1395904\" data-rawmessage=\"12:07PM\" id=\"webchat-msg-1395904\">\n\t<div class=\"messagebody\"><time class=\"o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2017-10-12T11:07:17.000Z\" title=\"Thu Oct 12 2017 11:07:17 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Thu Oct 12 2017 11:07:17 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tundefined\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time></div></div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1507806446\" data-mid=\"1395905\" data-rawmessage=\"Cripes, look at the time.\" id=\"webchat-msg-1395905\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">12:07pm</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>Cripes, look at the time.</p>\n</div></div><time class=\"marketslive-timestamp o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2017-10-12T11:08:15.000Z\" title=\"Thu Oct 12 2017 11:08:15 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Thu Oct 12 2017 11:08:15 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t12:08 pm\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1507806510\" data-mid=\"1395906\" data-rawmessage=\"Let&apos;s wrap up.
