Just looked at their latest H1 report, margins are so so, Debt level creeping up and a lot of adjustments to get to a large &#xA3;271m adjusted EBITDA level. Cash flow of &#xA3;96m suggests caveat emptor as I typically like businesses with an EBITDA and cash flow to be not as far apart. Capex and adjustments remind me of Thomas Cook for massaging the figures to get an adjusted number that is as large as possible and the analyst community buying that number! 18x EBITDA is very rich IMO\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1568113524\" data-mid=\"1453460\" data-rawmessage=\"Earnings growth of minus 20% I should say. $41.8m on an EBITDA level.\" id=\"webchat-msg-1453460\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">12:05pm</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>Earnings growth of minus 20% I should say. $41.8m on an EBITDA level.</p>\n</div></div><time class=\"marketslive-timestamp o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2019-09-10T11:05:30.000Z\" title=\"Tue Sep 10 2019 11:05:30 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Tue Sep 10 2019 11:05:30 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t12:05 pm\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1568113545\" data-mid=\"1453461\" data-rawmessage=\"Caz incoming.\" id=\"webchat-msg-1453461\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">12:05pm</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>Caz incoming.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"msg blockquote has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1568113586\" data-mid=\"1453463\" data-rawmessage=\"888&#x2019;s H1 19 results are in-line with our bullish outlook coming out of\nthe June CMD. 888 reported an organic/LFL revenue increase of 7%\norganic y/y (JPMe +5.3%).
