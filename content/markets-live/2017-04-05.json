Given all the attention &#x2013; not to mention that the heat turned at one point on Fed Chair Janet Yellen, who had also met Medley Global &#x2013; it&#x2019;s extraordinary it took this long to finger the culprit.</p>\n<p>That doesn&#x2019;t reflect well on Lacker, who admits to incomplete disclosure when he was interviewed by the Fed&#x2019;s general counsel in 2012. He says he was more forthcoming with outside law-enforcement officials in 2015. According to the Richmond Fed, its board responded to government investigations &#x2013; though it couldn&#x2019;t quite bring itself to say it had asked for Lacker&#x2019;s resignation, only that it took &#x201C;appropriate actions.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Most of all, though, it&#x2019;s hard not to conclude that the central bank dragged its feet. As the top regulator of big banks, the Fed urges them to do the right thing. &#x201C;A healthy culture is one where problems are identified early and promptly addressed,&#x201D; New York Fed boss Bill Dudley lectured bankers at a 2014 industry workshop. &#x201C;Do as I say, not as I do,&#x201D; isn&#x2019;t such a persuasive line.</p></blockquote>\n</div></div><time class=\"marketslive-timestamp o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2017-04-05T10:04:57.000Z\" title=\"Wed Apr 05 2017 10:04:57 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Wed Apr 05 2017 10:04:57 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t11:04 am\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1491386712\" data-mid=\"1372876\" data-rawmessage=\"I don&apos;t know about this case in detail\" id=\"webchat-msg-1372876\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">PM</span><span class=\"timestamp\">11:05am</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>I don&apos;t know about this case in detail</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1491386737\" data-mid=\"1372877\" data-rawmessage=\"And im not going to speculate on whether Medley are &apos;journalists&apos;

This is an\nincrease of ~36% compared with the anticipated synergies originally set out by the company, and continues to be risk adjusted, exercising a degree of\nprudence. As further information and analysis becomes available, Wood Group is also confident additional cost synergies can be realised in due course.\nThe additional synergies appear  to be linked to an increase in operational efficiencies&#x37E; and the total cost savings are expected to come from the following \nareas&#x37E; \nl Operating efficiencies: ~50% of cost synergies are expected to be generated from economies of scale in addressable operating cost, efficiencies in\noperational procurement spend and the reduction of duplicate costs across country and regional leadership;\nl Corporate efficiencies: ~20% of the cost synergies are expected to be generated from the reduction of duplicate costs across Board and executive\nleadership teams, in addition to other Corporate and Group functional costs;\nl Administration efficiencies: ~30% of the cost synergies are expected to be generated from the consolidation of overlapping office locations, the\nelimination of duplicated IT systems and the reduction of duplicate costs across central support functions. These anticipated synergies will accrue as a\ndirect result of the Combination and would not be achieved on a standalone basis.\nWood Group estimates one-off costs of ~$231m to realise these synergies are likely to be incurred in the first three years post-completion, which is unchanged\nfrom the original deal and synergies announcement. \nOur view: Wood Group&#x2019;s increase to the synergies estimate from this deal is in line with our expectation that the original $134m target materially\nunderestimated the opportunities for cost savings.

This is an<br>\nincrease of ~36% compared with the anticipated synergies originally set out by the company, and continues to be risk adjusted, exercising a degree of<br>\nprudence.
