While the Purplebricks UK remains cash generative, we estimate Purplebricks Australia may require up to &#xA3;10m cash investment to reach breakeven within 24 months and Purplebricks USA to require circa &#xA3;40m p.a. We expect the group to be cashflow positive from April 2020.<br>\nValuation: At 165p, Purplebricks&#x2019; share price, net of 23p cash per share, values the group on 3.2x our new forecast group revenue to April 2019.<br>\nWe expect Purplebricks UK to generate a positive EBITDA of over &#xA3;11m in the current year; double to over &#xA3;24m next and continue to grow strongly (see Exhibit 1). Valuing Purplebricks UK at 150p a share (i.e. &#xA3;455m) would be 5.2x FY(Apr)19E revenue; 4.0x prospective revenue and approximately 24x prospective divisional adj PAT with a PEG of under 1x.</p></blockquote>\n</div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">Flaneur</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDo we have a line on who else might be leaving UK/EU now that the Japanese trade deal is complete?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><time class=\"marketslive-timestamp o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2019-02-21T11:23:25.000Z\" title=\"Thu Feb 21 2019 11:23:25 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Thu Feb 21 2019 11:23:25 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t11:23 am\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1550748220\" data-mid=\"1437079\" data-rawmessage=\"Exhibit 1 looks like this.\" id=\"webchat-msg-1437079\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">11:23am</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>Exhibit 1 looks like this.</p>\n</div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">wayneJ</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI think all analysts modelling with Excel should be required to provide a track record of how inaccurate their historic forecasts have been.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">Soundbuy</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tProbably a lesson here - prove up the model in a domestic market before considering such international expansion....\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1550748290\" data-mid=\"1437080\" data-rawmessage=\"https://i.imgur.com/NDUISzZ.png\" id=\"webchat-msg-1437080\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">11:24am</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p><img class=\"picture\" src=\"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2F__origami%2Fservice%2Fimage%2Fv2%2Fimages%2Fraw%2Fhttps%253A%252F%252Fi.imgur.com%252FNDUISzZ.png%3Fsource%3DAlphaville%26width%3D675%26fit%3Dscale-down?source=Alphaville\"></p>\n</div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">Dec69 - Skeptic</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCentrica flame is dwindling\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">DJ</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t@wayne totally agree.

EPS came at 11.2p, below the 11.5p guidance provided in November, which was widely expected given the warm weather in the last few months of the year. Adjusted operating cashflow was 7% ahead of our forecast at &#xA3;2,245m and net debt at &#xA3;2,656m.<br>\n&#xF06E; Outlook &#x2013; Centrica is targeting FY19 adjusted operating cashflow (AOCF) of &#xA3;1.8-2.0bn and net debt (adjusted for IFRS 16) range of &#xA3;3.0-3.5bn. The mid-point of the AOCF reflects &#xA3;350m lower yoy and Centrica stated that they expect &#xA3;100m (c.2p/share) of this to fall through to EPS. The company has also announced a &#xA3;500m disposal, with &#xA3;230m of which through the announcement of sale of Clockwork Home Services business. Centrica is targeting &#xA3;250m efficiencies during FY19 and have increased its medium term cost saving program by a further &#xA3;500m.<br>\n&#xF06E; Implications &#x2014; Based on the outlook guidance provided, FY19 EPS is likely to be in the c.9.0p range. This compare to our 10.5p and consensus of 12.0p. This is likely to be the biggest hit to the share price today. Furthermore, the distinctive absence of any form of official commitment to the current 12p DPS is also likely to be a sign the company financial metrics are becoming increasingly on the edge</p></blockquote>\n</div></div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1550748766\" data-mid=\"1437095\" data-rawmessage=\"And RBC.\" id=\"webchat-msg-1437095\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">11:32am</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>And RBC.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"msg blockquote has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1550748778\" data-mid=\"1437096\" data-rawmessage=\"We continue to see limited future growth prospects in downstream operations of CNA, with the core business shrinking and new business struggling to mature.

Asia remains stable<br>\nat a &#x20AC;150m run-rate as expected. Current trading in the regulated B2B Gaming<br>\nbusiness is slightly improved at 7% (constant currency and excluding<br>\nacquisitions). The company guides to FY19 EBITDA &#x20AC;390-415m, above our &#x20AC;377m<br>\nforecast, but this is in-line when accounting for a &#x20AC;20m benefit from IFRS 16, and<br>\nweaker underlying as the company has announced a positive resolution to its<br>\nSun Bingo contract renegotiation, which will have a positive EBITDA contribution<br>\nin 2019 (loss making in FY18 and -&#x20AC;12m in our FY19 forecasts). There is no<br>\ncomment on GVC contract negotiations. Finally, the company has cut its final<br>\ndividend, with FY18 DPS of &#x20AC;0.24 (MSe &#x20AC;0.36) and rebalanced this with a &#x20AC;40m<br>\nbuyback, with overall distribution remaining in-line with expectations.
