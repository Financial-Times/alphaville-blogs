The acquisition of Wagamama has materially changed the composition of the business, creating a new avenue for growth to complement that of the pubs and\nconcessions, and counteract the more challenging trading conditions faced by the legacy Leisure brands. Following the completion of the acquisition, TRG&#x2019;s CEO resigned and a search is underway to appoint a successor. How TRG will look in 2019 is very different, then, to how it looked for most of 2018. From a trading\nperspective, 2018 was certainly a difficult year, but this was much as we had anticipated. LFL sales growth was\n(2.0)%, which was in line with our estimate. Adjusted PBT was down 8% to &#xA3;53.2 million, 4% above our\nestimate, although a prior year asset impairment meant 2018 depreciation was reduced by &#xA3;2.2 million, normalising for which adjusted PBT was &#xA3;51.0 million, in line with our estimate of &#xA3;51.2 million. Around 70% of outlet EBITDA now comes from the high-growth parts of TRG (Wagamama, pubs and concessions) and the\ncompany continues to launch new initiatives to ensure this growth is sustained. LFLs at the group level were 2.8% in the first 10 weeks of the year, which includes Wagamama.

The acquisition of Wagamama has materially changed the composition of the business, creating a new avenue for growth to complement that of the pubs and<br>\nconcessions, and counteract the more challenging trading conditions faced by the legacy Leisure brands. Following the completion of the acquisition, TRG&#x2019;s CEO resigned and a search is underway to appoint a successor. How TRG will look in 2019 is very different, then, to how it looked for most of 2018. From a trading<br>\nperspective, 2018 was certainly a difficult year, but this was much as we had anticipated. LFL sales growth was<br>\n(2.0)%, which was in line with our estimate. Adjusted PBT was down 8% to &#xA3;53.2 million, 4% above our<br>\nestimate, although a prior year asset impairment meant 2018 depreciation was reduced by &#xA3;2.2 million, normalising for which adjusted PBT was &#xA3;51.0 million, in line with our estimate of &#xA3;51.2 million. Around 70% of outlet EBITDA now comes from the high-growth parts of TRG (Wagamama, pubs and concessions) and the<br>\ncompany continues to launch new initiatives to ensure this growth is sustained. LFLs at the group level were 2.8% in the first 10 weeks of the year, which includes Wagamama. Our FY19 adjusted PBT estimate (before any start-up costs for new initiatives) is &#xA3;81.1 million.</p></blockquote>\n</div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">Mouselet</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWagamama at least has a half-plausible reputation and you might voluntarily go there with the main problem being that it&apos;s often too busy ...

We think H&amp;M is making progress in improving its product and omnichannel offer which should lead to an improvement in sales and margins over time. Sentiment remains dour but valuation is not yet compelling enough to be more positive. </p>\n<p>H&amp;M trades at c.20x CY19e P/E or 8.5x lease-adj.EV/EBITDAR which reflects in our view some prospects for recovery. Although the Persson family has been buying more shares than usual over the past year, we think the prospects of H&amp;M being taken private are unlikely (example of take-private media reports &#x2013; Reuters Sept 2018).
