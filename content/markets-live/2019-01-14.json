But, in practice, a &#x201C;no deal&#x201D; exit would require an impasse in Parliament over every feasible alternative, as well as insistence by the EU that the existing Article 50 deadline cannot be extended. In particular, a &#x201C;no deal&#x201D; departure would require Parliament to turn down the option of unilaterally revoking Article 50: an option which is now clear in legal terms, even if still muddied in terms of political viability. In our view, co-ordination failure on such a scale looks unlikely given the large macro impact of a &#x201C;no deal&#x201D; scenario, but it is not impossible.</p></blockquote>\n</div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">Maudise</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDo you think that no brexit is actually likely, or is a can-kick the more politically palatable thing to do?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">wayneJ</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe &apos;new&apos; Next 3 step programme has an APR of 29.9% if u miss a payment - https://www.next.co.uk/credit\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">red</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t@Maudisebercow moves now allows MP&apos;s to go straight to revoking article 50.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><time class=\"marketslive-timestamp o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2019-01-14T11:43:49.000Z\" title=\"Mon Jan 14 2019 11:43:49 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Mon Jan 14 2019 11:43:49 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t11:43 am\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1547466244\" data-mid=\"1434139\" data-rawmessage=\"&quot;We maintain our base case that Parliament will pave the way to a status quo post-Brexit transition phase, beginning at the end of March,&quot; concludes Goldman.\" id=\"webchat-msg-1434139\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">11:44am</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>&quot;We maintain our base case that Parliament will pave the way to a status quo post-Brexit transition phase, beginning at the end of March,&quot; concludes Goldman.</p>\n</div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">red</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tits just a question if MP&apos;s can live with going against referendum vote. nothing more than that now.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">Maudise</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWhat a time to be alive\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1547466277\" data-mid=\"1434140\" data-rawmessage=\"All of which is thrilling, of course, but how do you trade it?
