The $200 million disposal proceeds from Uganda have been pushed into 2019, although free cash flow of $410 million was still a little light (BMO $533 million, guidance $500 million) due to an adverse working capital swing. Net Debt was $3.1 billion (2017 $3.5 billion).<br>\n2019 Outlook. 2019 oil production guidance is set at 93-101 kbopd (BMO 95 kbopd, CMD loose guidance ~100 kbopd). Capex guidance is unchanged from the CMD and Tullow still expects to pay a dividend of at least $100 million in 2019.<br>\nGhana. Jubilee production was 78 kbopd, missing earlier guidance of 81.2 kbopd due to issues in December that have now been resolved. TEN production of 64.5 kbopd was in line. In 2019, Tullow expects to drill seven new wells and reiterates gross oil guidance of 180,000 bopd.<br>\nEast Africa. In Uganda, the farm down and FID are expected to complete in H1 2019. In Kenya, Tullow continues to target FID in late 2019 with first oil in 2022.<br>\nExploration. In Guyana, Tullow will drill the Jethro prospect in Q2 as the first of two planned wells on the Orinduik block. The Carapa prospect will be tested on the Kanuku licence in Q3 2019.<br>\nView and Valuation. Tullow trades at a 16% discount to our valuation of 238p/sh (sector 25% discount).</p></blockquote>\n</div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">Upaswellasdown</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t@VV75 I think Rakesh would have preferred a small drop in value upon the announcement rather than n/c\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">Timmmmmmmyyyyyy</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHello there, any chance you could divulge more on Millicom/Liberty?
