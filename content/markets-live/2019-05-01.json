Board has announced an additional $75B for share repurchases and increased its quarterly dividend +5% to $0.77.</p>\n<p>Thought: Don&#x2019;t look over there&#x2026; look over there. 65% of the business might rely on one key driver (aka iPhones) which is in severe decline (iPhone sales fell 17% YoY in the quarter) so the company has been trying to divert attention to services as the key high growth driver of the future. But these other services of app sales, streaming sales etc. only grew 16% YoY. It isn&#x2019;t at the hyper growth level it needs to be.</p>\n<p>So, in shades of IBM (not a good sign to be clear) Apple play their financial Ace card &#x2013; increase the size of their buyback by $75B &#x2013; the magnitude of which is more than the market cap of many companies.
