We highlight that nearly 1/3 of cash holdings were customer deposits ($920MM).</p></blockquote>\n</div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">Mouselet</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI think the fact that banks are willing to tell people applying for mortgages with them that they are overpaying is generally a good thing, though it seems sad that the people often seem to carry on with the same purchase anyway\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">Forester</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUK supermarkets do the same thing for example, but of course they are negotiating from a position of strength!\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><div class=\"msg blockquote has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1532342119\" data-mid=\"1422873\" data-rawmessage=\"Model S/X sales expect to remain lackluster: TSLA delivered 44.1k models of Model S/X in the 1H18, down 6.3% Y/Y vs. 1H17.
