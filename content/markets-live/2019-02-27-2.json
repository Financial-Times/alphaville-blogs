ITV believes that other broadcasters will join.  This comes with extra investment of &#xA3;25m in 2019E, &#xA3;40m in 2020E and declining thereafter.  The fact that this is a joint effort is positive, the investments less so.</p>\n<p>We would also highlight the fact that ITV&#x2019;s audience was up 3% to 17.1bn viewed hours across all devices in 2018.  Free-to-air television appears to decline less than the majority of the market believes it seems.</p>\n<p>Overall, when there are medium term questions, investors usually follow short-term trends and they are not positive for ITV.
