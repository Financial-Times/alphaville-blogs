As a result, management remains<br>\nconfident in its target of double-digit online NGR growth (NSe +8%). At the group<br>\nlevel, management is &quot;confident of delivering EBITDA ...in-line with expectations&quot; (NSe<br>\n&#xA3;636m EBITDA, consensus &#xA3;643m) and has committed to minimum annual dividend<br>\ngrowth of 10% (ie at least 36p vs. 34p NSe and consensus).<br>\n&#x25CF; Recommendation BUY: With growing market share, top line momentum, geographic<br>\ndiversification and greater regulatory visibility (eg post-UK Triennial Review), we<br>\nbelieve GVC is uniquely well placed. Trading on 8.9x FY19E EV/EBITDA and 5.2%<br>\ndividend yield, we reiterate our BUY recommendation.</p></blockquote>\n</div></div><div class=\"msg separator has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1551787604\" data-mid=\"1438172\" data-rawmessage=\"12:06PM\" id=\"webchat-msg-1438172\">\n\t<div class=\"messagebody\"><time class=\"o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2019-03-05T12:06:44.000Z\" title=\"Tue Mar 05 2019 12:06:44 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Tue Mar 05 2019 12:06:44 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tundefined\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time></div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">Pharma</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t@cracklenpop, neither is acceptable; we should just walk away.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">A.
