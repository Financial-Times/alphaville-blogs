The report suggested these<br>\nbids came from Vivendi and VOD and that the Murdochs<br>\nhad required 1800p per share to sell. Furthermore, SKY<br>\ntraded as high as 1126p at this time last year. There also<br>\nremains a real possibility that activists may push for a<br>\nbetter offer.</p>\n<p>Irrespective of its public positioning Fox is capable and<br>\nshould make a higher offer. A quick glimpse at valuations<br>\nhighlight that while Sky is trading at A PE of 15.7x, that is<br>\nstill at a 20% discount to the sector multiple of 19.6x<br>\nimplying a fair market valuation of 1,230p. Adding a<br>\nrealistic but &quot;low&quot; bid premium of 15%, implies that the<br>\nfair value of the take out is around the 1,415p level, and<br>\nthis is not even factoring in any synergies between Fox&apos;s<br>\ncontent portfolio and Sky&apos;s vast global reach and<br>\ncustomer base. We don&#x2019;t expect a bid to come at those<br>\nlevels however the argument is clear that at 1075p SKY is<br>\nbargain basement.</p></blockquote>\n</div></div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1481800870\" data-mid=\"1357457\" data-rawmessage=\"Anyway.\" id=\"webchat-msg-1357457\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">11:21am</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>Anyway.</p>\n</div></div><time class=\"marketslive-timestamp o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2016-12-15T11:20:58.000Z\" title=\"Thu Dec 15 2016 11:20:58 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Thu Dec 15 2016 11:20:58 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t11:20 am\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time><div class=\"msg separator has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1481800873\" data-mid=\"1357458\" data-rawmessage=\"11:20AM\" id=\"webchat-msg-1357458\">\n\t<div class=\"messagebody\"><time class=\"o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2016-12-15T11:21:13.000Z\" title=\"Thu Dec 15 2016 11:21:13 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Thu Dec 15 2016 11:21:13 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tundefined\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time></div></div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1481800947\" data-mid=\"1357459\" data-rawmessage=\"On Punch ....

Overall, the tone of the release was positive, including the following key points: 1) Adjusted operating cash flow is expected to be in the range &#xA3;2.4bn-2.6bn (JPMe &#xA3;2.27bn); 2) Group capital investment, including small acquisitions of less than &#xA3;100m each, is now expected to be around &#xA3;900m, below the &#xA3;1m limit set as part of the group&#x2019;s financial framework; 3) Efficiency savings increasing to over &#xA3;300m as part of the group&#x2019;s &#xA3;750m per annum cost efficiency programme with like-for-like operating costs expected to be lower in 2016 than in 2015, having absorbed the effects of inflation, foreign exchange movements and additional investment in the company&#x2019;s focus areas for growth; and 4) UK Home energy accounts broadly flat. As a result, the company expects FY adjusted earnings to be around 16.5p, which is above the top end of Bloomberg consensus and our JPMe 15.9p estimate</p></blockquote>\n</div></div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1481803665\" data-mid=\"1357543\" data-rawmessage=\"Must be bloody difficult for Centrica to try and beat expectations every quarter while making sure that British Gas doesn&apos;t do too well and end up on the front of the Daily Mail.\" id=\"webchat-msg-1357543\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">12:07pm</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>Must be bloody difficult for Centrica to try and beat expectations every quarter while making sure that British Gas doesn&apos;t do too well and end up on the front of the Daily Mail.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1481803693\" data-mid=\"1357544\" data-rawmessage=\"But anyway.
