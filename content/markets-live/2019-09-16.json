In reality, air fares almost always go up in response to higher fuel prices so the impact on EPS will be more muted than the table shows. The table clearly shows that the low cost carriers (LCCs) are more impacted by a change in the fuel price than IAG. This is because fuel represents a higher percentage of the total cost base of an LCC, since an LCC&#x2019;s other costs (eg. labour, airport fees etc) are lower than those of a full service carrier.</p></blockquote>\n</div></div><time class=\"marketslive-timestamp o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2019-09-16T10:22:13.000Z\" title=\"Mon Sep 16 2019 10:22:13 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Mon Sep 16 2019 10:22:13 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t11:22 am\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1568629348\" data-mid=\"1453890\" data-rawmessage=\"https://i.imgur.com/tezELqk.png\" id=\"webchat-msg-1453890\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">11:22am</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p><img class=\"picture\" src=\"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2F__origami%2Fservice%2Fimage%2Fv2%2Fimages%2Fraw%2Fhttps%253A%252F%252Fi.imgur.com%252FtezELqk.png%3Fsource%3DAlphaville%26width%3D675%26fit%3Dscale-down?source=Alphaville\"></p>\n</div></div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1568629421\" data-mid=\"1453891\" data-rawmessage=\"Open the image in a new tab if it&apos;s illegible.\" id=\"webchat-msg-1453891\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">11:23am</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>Open the image in a new tab if it&apos;s illegible.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"msg separator has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1568629444\" data-mid=\"1453892\" data-rawmessage=\"11:23AM\" id=\"webchat-msg-1453892\">\n\t<div class=\"messagebody\"><time class=\"o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2019-09-16T10:24:04.000Z\" title=\"Mon Sep 16 2019 10:24:04 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Mon Sep 16 2019 10:24:04 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tundefined\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time></div></div><time class=\"marketslive-timestamp o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2019-09-16T10:24:23.000Z\" title=\"Mon Sep 16 2019 10:24:23 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Mon Sep 16 2019 10:24:23 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t11:24 am\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1568629478\" data-mid=\"1453893\" data-rawmessage=\"Best mention the explorers, who (to state the obvious) have the highest leverage to these sorts of supply shocks.\" id=\"webchat-msg-1453893\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">11:24am</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>Best mention the explorers, who (to state the obvious) have the highest leverage to these sorts of supply shocks.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"msg price has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1568629482\" data-mid=\"1453894\" data-rawmessage=\"&lt;strong&gt;Premier Oil PLC (PMO:LSE):&lt;/strong&gt;
