We forecast an especially steep YoY decline in shipments of 200mm and smaller-diameter wafers amid weak demand from the auto sector, but we also anticipate a slump in shipments of 300mm wafers due to soft demand from Siltronic&#x2019;s customers in North America, which have been affected by the ban on exports to Huawei.
