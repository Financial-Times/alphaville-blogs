What stands out<br>\nhowever is that both candidates want to boost growth and inflation through increased fiscal<br>\nspending, especially infrastructure investment. In this context, we increase our US equity<br>\nexposure (+ 5 points to 19).<br>\nThe US Treasury market offers some protection thanks to a high carry versus other G10 bond<br>\nmarkets, and the Federal Reserve keeps saying it will increase rates somewhat (surprises<br>\nwould therefore come more from euro area tapering next year). We&#x2019;re however becoming shy<br>\nat the very long end of the curve of the sovereign bond market. What may be good for<br>\ncorporate assets (growth and inflation are good for corporate profits) may also be bad for<br>\nbonds. Our quantitative tools highlight a preference for cash over bonds in a risk-averse<br>\nscenario, clearly highlighting that bonds no longer offer defensive qualities.</p></blockquote>\n</div></div>\n\n<div class=\"msg blockquote has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1473761890\" data-mid=\"1344282\" data-rawmessage=\"Strong commodity exposure to protect from rising G10 inflation\nThis year the oil market absorbed excess capacity and reached a new equilibrium thanks to\nimproved demand and falling supply (both US shale oil and Canadian sands).
