The timing for BAT making another acquisition right now is not ideal following its move for Reynolds - net debt / EBITDA at the end of FY18e will be 3.1x on our numbers. This said, we estimate that if BAT acquired Imperial UK at 14x EV/EBIT or GBP8.5bn, it would add only 0.5x to BAT&#x2019;s net debt / EBITDA ratio. We estimate EPS accretion of around 4%.</p></blockquote>\n</div></div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1487764629\" data-mid=\"1366077\" data-rawmessage=\"It&apos;s only coming back because Exane&apos;s added IMB to some list.\" id=\"webchat-msg-1366077\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-2\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">11:57am</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>It&apos;s only coming back because Exane&apos;s added IMB to some list.</p>\n</div></div><time class=\"marketslive-timestamp o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2017-02-22T11:57:04.000Z\" title=\"Wed Feb 22 2017 11:57:04 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Wed Feb 22 2017 11:57:04 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t11:57 am\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1487764639\" data-mid=\"1366078\" data-rawmessage=\"ok\" id=\"webchat-msg-1366078\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">PM</span><span class=\"timestamp\">11:57am</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>ok</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"msg separator has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1487764645\" data-mid=\"1366079\" data-rawmessage=\"11:57AM\" id=\"webchat-msg-1366079\">\n\t<div class=\"messagebody\"><time class=\"o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2017-02-22T11:57:25.000Z\" title=\"Wed Feb 22 2017 11:57:25 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Wed Feb 22 2017 11:57:25 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tundefined\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time></div></div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1487764653\" data-mid=\"1366080\" data-rawmessage=\"Should we try and squeeze Lloyds in briefly?\" id=\"webchat-msg-1366080\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">PM</span><span class=\"timestamp\">11:57am</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>Should we try and squeeze Lloyds in briefly?</p>\n</div></div><time class=\"marketslive-timestamp o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2017-02-22T11:57:25.000Z\" title=\"Wed Feb 22 2017 11:57:25 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Wed Feb 22 2017 11:57:25 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t11:57 am\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1487764660\" data-mid=\"1366081\" data-rawmessage=\"Cos we&apos;ve managed to avoid...\" id=\"webchat-msg-1366081\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">PM</span><span class=\"timestamp\">11:57am</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>Cos we&apos;ve managed to avoid...</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1487764692\" data-mid=\"1366082\" data-rawmessage=\"Uh, I have to admit to not reading Lloyds this morning.\" id=\"webchat-msg-1366082\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-2\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">11:58am</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>Uh, I have to admit to not reading Lloyds this morning.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1487764720\" data-mid=\"1366083\" data-rawmessage=\"http://www.investegate.co.uk/lloyds-banking-group--lloy-/rns/final-results/201702220700104883X/\" id=\"webchat-msg-1366083\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">PM</span><span class=\"timestamp\">11:58am</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p><a href=\"http://www.investegate.co.uk/lloyds-banking-group--lloy-/rns/final-results/201702220700104883X/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.investe...1702220700104883X/</a></p>\n</div></div><time class=\"marketslive-timestamp o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2017-02-22T11:58:27.000Z\" title=\"Wed Feb 22 2017 11:58:27 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Wed Feb 22 2017 11:58:27 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t11:58 am\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1487764722\" data-mid=\"1366084\" data-rawmessage=\"The numbers both beat and missed, according to the press coverage.\" id=\"webchat-msg-1366084\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-2\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">11:58am</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>The numbers both beat and missed, according to the press coverage.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1487764743\" data-mid=\"1366085\" data-rawmessage=\"Ah, have Deutsche Bank.

Even if we assume that it equates to 75% of the H2 results (Q4 weighted profits), that is a 50% warning on the remaining profit in the year.<br>\nThe lateness in reporting ahead of the CMD suggests this is not merely a trading issue but a financial reporting issue. Our concern is that it may affect revenue recognition or cost allocation. This is driven by ongoing concern about the weak cash conversion linked to accrued income.<br>\nThe company&apos;s lowered EBITDA forecast suggests FCF could be negative this financial year, and assuming the current run rate of profitability into FY18, net debt could rise to c2x net/debt EBITDA without a cut in dividends.</p></blockquote>\n</div></div><div class=\"msg blockquote has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1487764918\" data-mid=\"1366103\" data-rawmessage=\"With this level of uncertainty, we switch our valuation methodology keeping Escrow as a DCF derived value and moving Assurance from a profit multiple to a disposal multiple based on sales (due to the current profit uncertainty).
