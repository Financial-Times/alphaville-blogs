It is also a big year for IT with the human resources and estate management modules of the new SAP system being installed in the next quarter, with payroll due to follow in early 2019. The higher dual-running costs and the accelerated depreciation are broadly covered by the &#xA3;6.1m exceptional charge for this year.</p></blockquote>\n</div></div><time class=\"marketslive-timestamp o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2018-10-09T10:25:30.000Z\" title=\"Tue Oct 09 2018 10:25:30 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Tue Oct 09 2018 10:25:30 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t11:25 am\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time><div class=\"msg blockquote has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1539080745\" data-mid=\"1428111\" data-rawmessage=\"Once these projects are complete, it will have the capacity to grow to c.2,500 shops, a 32% increase in shop capacity.
