The culture secretary, Karen Bradley, is an unknown quantity, having come from a different ministry, while Sharon White, head of OFCOM, has been taking a tough line with companies that are not driving benefits for consumers.<br>\n&#x25CF; Fox wants direct access to consumers: We think the primary rationale for the deal is access to customers. Media distribution has changed hugely since 2010, and it is the rise of Netflix, Amazon Prime and other over-thetop services that is driving this deal, we believe. It helps, of course, that Sky has de-rated substantially following investor concern about quality and predictability of earnings. We do not see any other bidder, but suspect that this deal will take quite some time to clear. We upgrade Sky to Hold on the basis that the deal will ultimately clear, with conditions, at 1,075p.</p></blockquote>\n</div></div><time class=\"marketslive-timestamp o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2016-12-12T11:19:06.000Z\" title=\"Mon Dec 12 2016 11:19:06 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Mon Dec 12 2016 11:19:06 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t11:19 am\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time><div class=\"msg separator has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1481541561\" data-mid=\"1356863\" data-rawmessage=\"11:19AM\" id=\"webchat-msg-1356863\">\n\t<div class=\"messagebody\"><time class=\"o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2016-12-12T11:19:21.000Z\" title=\"Mon Dec 12 2016 11:19:21 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Mon Dec 12 2016 11:19:21 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tundefined\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time></div></div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1481541629\" data-mid=\"1356864\" data-rawmessage=\"Meanwhile, in the busted-flush M&amp;A category .......\" id=\"webchat-msg-1356864\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">11:20am</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>Meanwhile, in the busted-flush M&amp;A category .......</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"msg price has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1481541639\" data-mid=\"1356865\" data-rawmessage=\"&lt;strong&gt;Ladbrokes Coral Group PLC (LCL:LSE):&lt;/strong&gt;
