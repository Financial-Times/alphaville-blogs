Should the reported acquisition of Tiffany by LVMH materialize, this would suggest a c2% negative impact to LVMH&apos;s share price (Tiffany is covered by Kimberly Greenberger). As we explain below, a hypothetical transaction would carry a number of risks. One of the main risks relates to Tiffany&apos;s strong American DNA and LVMH&apos;s mixed track record with acquisitions in the United States. That being said, when it comes to acquisitions in jewellery, LVMH has a very strong track record (e.g. Bulgari). Tiffany&apos;s profitability relative to its size is significantly below industry average and we see a number of potential areas for material improvement. We remain Overweight LVMH shares. What&apos;s new? Saturday and Sunday, several publications (first Bloomberg, followed by the Financial Times and Reuters), citing several unidentified sources, reported that LVMH had approached Tiffany with a takeover proposal earlier this month. According to the Wall Street Journal, LVMH sent Tiffany officials a letter in the last couple of weeks outlining an all-cash takeover bid of roughly $120 a share. As per the different publications, Tiffany has hired advisers and is currently evaluating the bid and there is no guarantee an agreement will be reached. Both LVMH and Tiffany have declined to comment. This would be LVMH&apos;s largest acquisition, should a deal materialize. As of Friday&apos;s share price of $98.55, Tiffany&apos;s market capitalization and enterprise value stood at respectively $12.0bn (&#x20AC;10.8bn) and $12.1bn (&#x20AC;10.9bn). Assuming a share price of $118-138 (a ~20-40% premium to Friday&apos;s close, in line with previous large transaction in the space), Tiffany&apos;s market capitalization could reach ~&#x20AC;13-15.0bn. The acquisition of Bulgari in March 2011 (for a total consideration of &#x20AC;4.3bn) is LVMH largest acquisition to date. On a relative basis, however, the transactions would be broadly similar: EV/mkt capitalization of 8.5% for Bulgari in 2011 and about 7.5% for Tiffany today (assuming a premium of 20-40% and that a transaction goes ahead) - as of Friday, LVMH&apos;s market capitalization stood at &#x20AC;194bn.

We think the<br>\nstrategic value of this asset is significantly higher than LVMH&#x2019;s $120/share offer, and<br>\nexpect TIF to quickly dismiss LVMH&#x2019;s initial proposal for 2 key reasons:<br>\n1) Recent Stock Peak: TIF traded at $140/share in 2018 (we think TIF&#x2019;s Board will<br>\nbe reticent to accept a bid below recent highs); and<br>\n2) 2x the EPS Power? A peer analysis suggests TIF&#x2019;s underlying EPS power could<br>\nbe as much as 2x higher than current Consensus 2019 ests.<br>\nWe think the bid could reach $140 quickly (in-line with TIF&#x2019;s recent high, or equity market<br>\nvalue of ~$17B). $140/share would imply ~17x Street 2019E EBITDA (above the luxury<br>\npeer avg of ~15x over the last 3 years) and ~17.6x ttm EBITDA (vs avg luxury M&amp;A<br>\nmultiple of ~19x).<br>\n&#x25A0; Valuation: We&#x2019;re raising our target price to $140 from $113 previously based on ~14x<br>\nour CY21 EBITDA (in line with the luxury peer group avg over the last 3 years and vs. our<br>\nprior 11x target EV/EBITDA). Our target price implies a P/E of ~24x our CY21 EPS (inline<br>\nwith the luxury peer group avg over the last 3 years).</p></blockquote>\n</div></div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1572264066\" data-mid=\"1457905\" data-rawmessage=\"(@VV75: it would&apos;ve been more than 22% this time last week.)\" id=\"webchat-msg-1457905\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">12:01pm</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>(@VV75: it would&apos;ve been more than 22% this time last week.)</p>\n</div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">BornCynic</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThanks BE / ROTR\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">VV75</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfair enough, my point still stands\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">tangledodyssey</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBE, thank you and good afternoon.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1572264141\" data-mid=\"1457906\" data-rawmessage=\"Not much mention of the possibility of a Kering counterbid, which must be a reasonable prospect.\" id=\"webchat-msg-1457906\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">12:02pm</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>Not much mention of the possibility of a Kering counterbid, which must be a reasonable prospect.</p>\n</div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">Soundbuy</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTa\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">Pete</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcheers\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><time class=\"marketslive-timestamp o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2019-10-28T12:02:56.000Z\" title=\"Mon Oct 28 2019 12:02:56 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Mon Oct 28 2019 12:02:56 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t12:02 pm\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1572264191\" data-mid=\"1457907\" data-rawmessage=\"Richemont and Kering both rumoured to be bidding back in 2010 at $120 a share or thereabouts.\" id=\"webchat-msg-1457907\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">12:03pm</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>Richemont and Kering both rumoured to be bidding back in 2010 at $120 a share or thereabouts.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1572264218\" data-mid=\"1457908\" data-rawmessage=\"Which at the time was a 65% premium.\" id=\"webchat-msg-1457908\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">12:03pm</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>Which at the time was a 65% premium.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1572264255\" data-mid=\"1457909\" data-rawmessage=\"LVMH was rumoured around the same time to be looking at Burberry, which never happened either.\" id=\"webchat-msg-1457909\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">12:04pm</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>LVMH was rumoured around the same time to be looking at Burberry, which never happened either.</p>\n</div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">GBKrona</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThank you @BE, rabble\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><time class=\"marketslive-timestamp o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2019-10-28T12:05:03.000Z\" title=\"Mon Oct 28 2019 12:05:03 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Mon Oct 28 2019 12:05:03 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t12:05 pm\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1572264318\" data-mid=\"1457910\" data-rawmessage=\"The problem with Tiffany, of course, is that it&apos;s American.
