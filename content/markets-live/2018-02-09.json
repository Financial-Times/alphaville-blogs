The Aerospace business is comprised of 50% commercial aerospace with an equal split of OE and AM. The remainder of the business is split between military and business jets. WWD&apos;s largest customers include GE and BA, which accounted for 16% and 11% of revenues in 2017. Sales to BA were up from 8% in 2016. In addition to BA, UTX and Airbus are sizable customers for WWD, but account for less than 10% of revenues. Although some portion of airframe sales may be at risk, the systems business is largely sold to the engine OEMs and are also under long-term contracts. There are several reasons why the transaction makes sense in our view. First, BA is focused on lowering unit costs. There are three factors which drive unit cost including model mix, supply chain, and labor / productivity costs. Supply chain is the largest cost in our view and could account for 60-65% of the cost base. As such, the company has focused on supply chain costs through Partnering for Success initiatives as well as vertical integration. One example, is the company&apos;s JV with Adient. Given issues in the supply chain and relatively low barriers to entry, BA formed a JV with Adient to develop and manufacture economy class seats. In another step in July 2017, BA announced it would create its own in-house avionics unit with a start of 500 employees. Another area of interest for BA includes actuation. BA has operations at its Sheffield and Portland facilities to build actuation systems for 777s and 737s. WWD&apos;s operations would add scale with both actuation and airframe content across several platforms including the 747 (WWD&apos;s current content of $800K), 777X ($430K), 737MAX ($275K), and 787 ($230K) platforms. Another potential merit for the transaction could be WWD&apos;s new facilities. The company has invested greater than $500MM in three new facilities over the past several years. Two of the facilities are primarily dedicated to aerospace and focused on the company&apos;s ramp in its commercial aerospace business, which we forecast to grow at a 12% rate over the next few years.
