We note that the growth of the high quality recurring revenue came in broadly in line with our expectations at 11.4% yoy in 3QFY19 (vs. GSe: 11.2%), with software subscription organic growth in line to better than our expectations (3QFY19 growth of 28.3% vs GSe of 27%).<br>\nOn the other hand, the company lowered the operating margin guidance for FY19 towards the lower end of the earlier guided range of 23-25%. While Sage also communicated that it now expects recurring revenue to grow slightly above the 8%-9% range, we note that the street is already at c.10% growth for recurring revenue. All in, we expect the near term street estimates to come down modestly, given the lowered operating margin guidance.</p></blockquote>\n</div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">Tom Dalgleish</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThat could better be put in a table of numbers\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">Tom Dalgleish</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIt mixes qualitative with quantitative in a narrative which breaks reader focus\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1564051637\" data-mid=\"1450978\" data-rawmessage=\"And ... oh, here comes George O&apos;Connor at Stifel.\" id=\"webchat-msg-1450978\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">11:47am</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>And ... oh, here comes George O&apos;Connor at Stifel.</p>\n</div></div><time class=\"marketslive-timestamp o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2019-07-25T10:47:08.000Z\" title=\"Thu Jul 25 2019 10:47:08 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Thu Jul 25 2019 10:47:08 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t11:47 am\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time><div class=\"msg blockquote has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1564051643\" data-mid=\"1450979\" data-rawmessage=\"Sage Q3 - &quot;106 miles to Chicago, a full tank of gas, half a\npack of cigarettes . . .&quot;\" id=\"webchat-msg-1450979\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">11:47am</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><blockquote><p>Sage Q3 - &quot;106 miles to Chicago, a full tank of gas, half a<br>\npack of cigarettes . . .&quot;</p></blockquote>\n</div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">red</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsage may need to wash out to around 650 but should be ok. once the numbers start coming thru it will be in the sp, so its one of these if u believe they can execute the move to cloud, then the sp may behave a bit like adobe did thru that time.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1564051661\" data-mid=\"1450980\" data-rawmessage=\"............... o ...... kay ......?\" id=\"webchat-msg-1450980\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">11:47am</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>............... o ...... kay ......?</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"msg blockquote has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1564051665\" data-mid=\"1450981\" data-rawmessage=\"Q3 Update report has &#x2018;puts and takes&#x2019;.

Cash and cash equivalents have declined to $127.6m (including the $100m from the<br>\nPetersen sale). This compares to $237.5m at the end of 2018 and $236.0m at the end of<br>\nH1&#x2019;18. Unless BUR is able to raise external sources of funding, our current forecast for onbalance<br>\nsheet additions of $742.8m for the full year ($657.7m in FY18) appears to be a stretch<br>\ntoo far ($147.2m deployed ytd). Stock trades on forecast FY19 cash NAV of 5.1x CY19 falling to<br>\n4.2x CY20 for a forecast 23% cash ROE through our forecast period.
