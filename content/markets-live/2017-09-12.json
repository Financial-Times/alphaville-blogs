Jumping by 2.4% m/m, the August rise was larger than in the same month of 2016 (+1.0%); according to the ONS, the unexpected rise may have been influenced by a different proportion of items on sales this year compared to last. Weather conditions have led brands to front-run winter collections and end summer sales early, pushing up the average prices of items sold in August relative to last year. First indications (strong fashion sales numbers by John Lewis and lower markdowns by Primark) are that this is also likely to be the case in September. Also within core goods, furniture, household equipment &amp; routine maintenance provided support albeit to a much lesser extent (+0.02). There were also notable developments at services level where the support was broad based. Communication, recreation &amp; culture and hotels, cafes &amp; restaurants prices all contributed positively for 0.11pp in total; air fares subtracted 0.04pp. At the non-core level, the bulk of the support was from cane with fuel and lubricants, which rose to 5.1% y/y from 2.0% in July, which was slightly tempered by weak food and drink (-0.05pp).\n\nRPI saw a positive base effect from last year&#x2019;s BoE rate cut dropping out of the y/y mortgage interest rate payment comparison. However, this will likely temporarily reverse in September owing to erratic behavior in this component last year stemming from erroneous effective interest rate assumptions. Otherwise, petrol prices have a higher weight in RPI than CPIH and use a point estimate rather than a whole month average (which CPIH uses), so the upside news here was more pronounced.\n\nToday&#x2019;s print suggests upside risks to our projected inflation profile for this year and next. Cheapening currency and rising oil prices are the most obvious factors to blame.
