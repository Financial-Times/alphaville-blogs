Italy win margins were soft too. FX would have been a headwind in March too. Combining these two factors (both out of the company&#x2019;s control) NGR growth in March slowed. By now this should not be a surprise to the market but it could be seen as a negative by some. 2) Comps are tough going forward (the World Cup is likely to have had a 2-4% NGR benefit post substitution), so as GVC annualizes that event, growth will slow. That said, our estimates (and Bloomberg consensus) seem to have more than factored that in (see table below where our FY19 estimates imply online NGR slows from +17% to +9% in Q2-4 19). If anything after such a strong start, we see scope for upgrades in H2 from stronger than expected top line growth. This coupled with a c. 40% contribution margin online and strong cost control (note staff are incentivsed on EBITDA) means operational gearing could be in evidence in H219 (halting the run of regulation driven downgrades. 3) The whistle to whistle advertising ban could be EBITDA positive for GVC in H219 so we see scope for a c. &#xA3;10m opex-driven EBITDA upgrade in H2 19 too. 4) Finally, Retail trading was strong in March. GVC trades on a CY20 P/E of 8.2x, a FCF Yield of 11.5% and a dividend yield of 7%. It is a cheap share.
