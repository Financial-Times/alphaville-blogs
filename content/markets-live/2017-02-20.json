In the interim, we increase our forecast Attributable Loss to &#xA3;6.3bn in 2016e, (previously &#xA3;5.7bn), and we cut our forecast for 2016e tNAV per share to 304p (from 310p) vs 352p in 2015. We continue to forecast a tenth successive annual loss in 2017e with a return to profit in 2018e, and we modestly raise our 2018/19e forecasts to reflect (1) the retention of the W&amp;G business (for which we forecast a profit before tax of &#xA3;320m in 2016e); and (2) the likely absence of a disposal loss.</p>\n<p>One key beneficiary of the proposed &#x201C;dowries&#x201D; may be Virgin Money (Buy). Virgin placed its SME roll-out on hold in July 2016 but is (we think) now &#x201C;re-incentivised&#x201D; to proceed. Options for the &#x201C;branch-free&#x201D; specialist banks are perhaps less certain, though it is proposed that RBS will grant access to its branch network for business customers of challengers to facilitate &#x201C;switching&#x201D;.</p>\n<p>Trading on 0.8x 2016e tNAV with, we think, no return to profit before 2018e, our Sell rec is maintained. However, we raise our TP to 225p (from 205p).</p></blockquote>\n</div></div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1487592013\" data-mid=\"1365650\" data-rawmessage=\"Trader Gordon been a tad offside on RBS.
