A business model that prioritises shareholder returns over growth has been pilloried by the bears after the $8.8bn acquisition of HPE Software in late 2017 failed to deliver on its promises. Our analysis suggests that while mistakes have been made, the model is not broken and we believe the outcome of the strategic review will represent the first step on the road to rebuilding a long-term reputation for maximising shareholder returns through the execution of an unconventional, but highly effective business model, focused on margins and cash.</p></blockquote>\n</div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">tangledodyssey</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNo idea but reportedly all the TC high street shops are to reopen immediately.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1570619019\" data-mid=\"1456060\" data-rawmessage=\"Price suggests a worst-case scenario of accelerating revenue declines and stagnating margins, which looks unlikely given management&apos;s trying to clean out the crap, he says.\" id=\"webchat-msg-1456060\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">12:03pm</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>Price suggests a worst-case scenario of accelerating revenue declines and stagnating margins, which looks unlikely given management&apos;s trying to clean out the crap, he says.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"msg blockquote has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1570619047\" data-mid=\"1456061\" data-rawmessage=\"The market appears to be fixated with the top line and is, in our view, underestimating management&#x2019;s potential to slow revenue declines, take out more costs, raise margins, generate cash and re-establish its strong cash-generating credentials and delivery of high TSRs.
