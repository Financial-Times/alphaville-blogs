More importantly, Zalando has reiterated ambition to scale GMV to &#x20AC;20bn, targeting 2023/24 and implying CAGR of at least 21%. Zalando claims to have resolved issues on PP through 2018 and therefore this GMV target includes at least 40% of GMV through PP, with 75% of this to be done through ZFS long term. Long term it is targeting a 10-13% adj group EBIT margin, including 6-8% for wholesale and 20-25% for PP. To get to these targets Zalando is guiding to EBIT margins of 2-4% and FCF negative across FY19-21e (Citi 2021e adj EBIT margin 4.2%, FCF margin 1.1%) which is likely to be focus of investors worried that business focusses too much on growth and too little on profitability.</p></blockquote>\n</div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">red</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tposs law of diminishing returns for online rag trade\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1551354754\" data-mid=\"1437732\" data-rawmessage=\"Hm.

If it does, then we will have to wait several more years before we hear the final outcome.<br>\n&#xF06E; However we think it is likely that the Canadian subsidiaries will be put into Administration &#x2013; ITCAN has a 48% share of the legal cigarette market in Canada, and BAT has said several times that it might well put ITCAN into Administration, which is the Canadian equivalent of Chapter 11, perhaps even if the Quebec ruling is positive. We think that ultimately all the Canadian cases need to be settled, and that the best way of starting negotiations is to put the legal industry into bankruptcy Administration, and threaten to close it down. However, we think this sort of negotiation would take many, many years.</p></blockquote>\n</div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">Tom Dalgleish</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPLC could divorce it\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1551355928\" data-mid=\"1437775\" data-rawmessage=\"Canada accounts for about 2% of BAT&#x2019;s operating profit\" id=\"webchat-msg-1437775\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">12:12pm</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>Canada accounts for about 2% of BAT&#x2019;s operating profit</p>\n</div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">PBateman</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tflog the brand rights in canada and close it?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">simple simon</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinchcape?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1551356029\" data-mid=\"1437776\" data-rawmessage=\"If BAT put its Canada division into admin it would lose the cash held in escrow re the Montreal fine but that would be about it, really.\" id=\"webchat-msg-1437776\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">12:13pm</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>If BAT put its Canada division into admin it would lose the cash held in escrow re the Montreal fine but that would be about it, really.</p>\n</div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">PBateman</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tspose the lawyers will find a way out\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><time class=\"marketslive-timestamp o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2019-02-28T12:13:41.000Z\" title=\"Thu Feb 28 2019 12:13:41 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Thu Feb 28 2019 12:13:41 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t12:13 pm\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time><div class=\"msg separator has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1551356036\" data-mid=\"1437777\" data-rawmessage=\"12:13PM\" id=\"webchat-msg-1437777\">\n\t<div class=\"messagebody\"><time class=\"o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2019-02-28T12:13:56.000Z\" title=\"Thu Feb 28 2019 12:13:56 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Thu Feb 28 2019 12:13:56 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tundefined\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time></div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">GBKrona</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthanks @BE, ROTR\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1551356114\" data-mid=\"1437778\" data-rawmessage=\"It&apos;s gone midday and yet, here we still are.\" id=\"webchat-msg-1437778\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">12:15pm</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>It&apos;s gone midday and yet, here we still are.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1551356165\" data-mid=\"1437779\" data-rawmessage=\"Here&apos;s a wall of text from James Hamilton at Numis on Arrow Global.\" id=\"webchat-msg-1437779\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">12:16pm</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>Here&apos;s a wall of text from James Hamilton at Numis on Arrow Global.</p>\n</div></div><time class=\"marketslive-timestamp o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2019-02-28T12:16:31.000Z\" title=\"Thu Feb 28 2019 12:16:31 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Thu Feb 28 2019 12:16:31 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t12:16 pm\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time><div class=\"msg blockquote has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1551356206\" data-mid=\"1437780\" data-rawmessage=\"Arrow reported total income (net interest income plus fee income) growth of 13.4% to &#xA3;313.0m against our forecast of &#xA3;296.9m with external Asset Management income increasing to 25.4% of group income from 22.7% last year.
