Previous guidance had been for EBIT margins to be c2% and, according to Bloomberg, consensus was forecasting Pre Tax Profits of around &#xA3;56m, so this is a downgrade of around 40%, albeit that is largely due to the &apos;law of small numbers&apos;.- The profit downgrade appears to more than feed through into the cash flow statement; the company is now guiding to year-end net debt of &#xA3;100m, versus &#xA3;50m previously. Any near-term concerns about financing, however, are likely to be allayed by the fact that the company has secured a new, 5-year, &#xA3;350m revolving credit facility.- All in all, this is a poor statement. However, Markit data suggests that ASOS had become one of the most shorted stocks in Europe, so there will have been a lot of investors anticipating something like this, making it difficult to predict how the shares will react today.</p></blockquote>\n</div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">1966AndAllThat</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t@Grouchmonkey  @AM  :)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><time class=\"marketslive-timestamp o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2019-07-18T11:01:03.000Z\" title=\"Thu Jul 18 2019 11:01:03 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Thu Jul 18 2019 11:01:03 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t12:01 pm\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1563447678\" data-mid=\"1450439\" data-rawmessage=\"That was Morgan Stanley.\" id=\"webchat-msg-1450439\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">12:01pm</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>That was Morgan Stanley.</p>\n</div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">BornCynic</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThanks BE / ROTR\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">SoS</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t&quot;A recent University of Florida study has found that the plastic most commonly used in water and soda bottles can release antimony and bisphenol A (the dreaded BPA) if it&apos;s exposed to heat over a long period of time.&quot;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">Excel Developer</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t#ECB #Inflation: well I dunno where Bloomberg got its headline from, perhaps a market participant who has already read those studies released today.
