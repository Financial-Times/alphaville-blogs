The divi will obviously go.<br>\nEBITDA estimates go from &#xA3;8.2m to &#xA3;4.5m this year, &#xA3;7.6m to &#xA3;1.3m next.<br>\nHard to be positive. There&#x2019;s always a temptation to try to catch a falling knife but not in this instance. Until management can come up with a coherent plan to turn the situation around, the shares are going to find it hard to stabilise. 4x FY21 EBITDA would feel generous but would mean an EV and mkt cap of &#xA3;15m and a TP of 12p. The shares are not worth bottom fishing for.

We increase our eFCF estimates by 3.1% in FY19E, and note that a higher level of growth capex  in  2018E  drove  a  slightly  weaker  level  of  eFCF  in  2018  relative  to  our expectations. The CARE JV closed on Tuesday (fear #3, see: Saudi JV closes, 5 March2019), which we consider to be a positive development and look forward to further detail here in due course.  With sentiment subdued on the stock based on our recent discussions with investors as well as a 9% short base, we expect these results to be taken well by the market.</p></blockquote>\n</div></div><time class=\"marketslive-timestamp o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2019-03-07T11:29:08.000Z\" title=\"Thu Mar 07 2019 11:29:08 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Thu Mar 07 2019 11:29:08 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t11:29 am\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1551958163\" data-mid=\"1438338\" data-rawmessage=\"Turns out, when you have overhanging questions about accounting policies plus a lot of debt and a tight free float, there&apos;s no guarantee of incremental progress being taken positively.\" id=\"webchat-msg-1438338\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">11:29am</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>Turns out, when you have overhanging questions about accounting policies plus a lot of debt and a tight free float, there&apos;s no guarantee of incremental progress being taken positively.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"msg separator has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1551958168\" data-mid=\"1438339\" data-rawmessage=\"11:29AM\" id=\"webchat-msg-1438339\">\n\t<div class=\"messagebody\"><time class=\"o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2019-03-07T11:29:28.000Z\" title=\"Thu Mar 07 2019 11:29:28 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Thu Mar 07 2019 11:29:28 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tundefined\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time></div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">red</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\talfa up strongly, every day has its day or am i missing something\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">1st Lt.

Today&#x2019;s dividend announcement (30 pence per share) equates to trailing yield of 7.0% which is the highest ordinary yield of any European multi-line insurer. This yield should also grow in-line with the group&#x2019;s operating performance, but is a progressive dividend meaning downside risk is removed.
