However, at our GBP160m synergy, going above GBp190, the deal ceases to offer double-digit returns.\n Given the all-cash offer from Steinhoff and its deeper pockets, our default expectation must be that eventually Steinhoff wins out, even though it seemingly lacks access to the same level of synergy. In this case, some of the recent negative share performance from Sainsbury could ultimately reverse. Don&apos;t get too excited though. Absent the optimism surrounding the importance of the Argos tie-up, the market is left with the tacit strategic concerns of Sainsbury management for a group operating as a pure-play food retailer.\n Sainsbury has shown a clear desire to obtain the Argos asset, and has &apos;played its hand&apos; in doing so, tacitly admitting that it expects to struggle if solely reliant on the Food business to drive the P&amp;L. As such, we expect Sainsbury will come back with a counter-bid (could be Monday morning - the due diligence deadline is on Tuesday), though we think it will be unwilling to go near GB200p. We accordingly anticipate a counter-bid in the region of GBp185, and if so expect Sainsbury will also talk to a synergy figure above the GBP120m initially guided.

However, at our GBP160m synergy, going above GBp190, the deal ceases to offer double-digit returns.<br>\n Given the all-cash offer from Steinhoff and its deeper pockets, our default expectation must be that eventually Steinhoff wins out, even though it seemingly lacks access to the same level of synergy. In this case, some of the recent negative share performance from Sainsbury could ultimately reverse. Don&apos;t get too excited though. Absent the optimism surrounding the importance of the Argos tie-up, the market is left with the tacit strategic concerns of Sainsbury management for a group operating as a pure-play food retailer.<br>\n Sainsbury has shown a clear desire to obtain the Argos asset, and has &apos;played its hand&apos; in doing so, tacitly admitting that it expects to struggle if solely reliant on the Food business to drive the P&amp;L. As such, we expect Sainsbury will come back with a counter-bid (could be Monday morning - the due diligence deadline is on Tuesday), though we think it will be unwilling to go near GB200p. We accordingly anticipate a counter-bid in the region of GBp185, and if so expect Sainsbury will also talk to a synergy figure above the GBP120m initially guided.
