notes (&#x2018;Initial Bonds&#x2019;) due 2027. The company intends to relaunch the offer &#x201C;when conditions have improved later this quarter&#x201D;. In practice, we expect that this would be sometime in September 2019.\n\nTo re-cap, Sirius is now at the crucial juncture of its US$3.8bn Stage 2 financing package for the construction of its paradigm-shifting North Yorkshire polyhalite project in England.\n\nSirius successfully completed the first phase (henceforth &#x2018;Stage 2a&#x2019;) of this package earlier in 2019, raising US$425m of equity and US$400m of convertible bonds.\nThe current stage, the US$3.0bn &#x2018;Senior Debt Event&#x2019; (&#x2018;Stage 2b&#x2019;), involves: raising at least US$500m of Initial Bonds or other acceptable financing; and entering into a US$2.5bn Revolving Credit Facility (RCF). Each of the senior debt components would be conditional (amongst other things) on the other being available. The Event is also a condition for the released of escrowed Stage 2a convertible proceeds.\nWe expect the Senior Debt Event to catalyse a major re-rating of the shares, as it is in our view effectively the key to unlocking Sirius&#x2019;s vast value potential. Beyond that, while Sirius would still be some years from becoming cash generative, an investment in the company should become progressively de-risked and enjoy significant value uplift as it advances towards production, we believe.\" id=\"webchat-msg-1451901\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">11:12am</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><blockquote><p>Given the current market turmoil (e.g. the escalating US-China dispute), Sirius has decided to suspend for now its proposed offer of US$500m of senior secured notes (&#x2018;Initial Bonds&#x2019;) due 2027. The company intends to relaunch the offer &#x201C;when conditions have improved later this quarter&#x201D;. In practice, we expect that this would be sometime in September 2019.</p>\n<p>To re-cap, Sirius is now at the crucial juncture of its US$3.8bn Stage 2 financing package for the construction of its paradigm-shifting North Yorkshire polyhalite project in England.</p>\n<p>Sirius successfully completed the first phase (henceforth &#x2018;Stage 2a&#x2019;) of this package earlier in 2019, raising US$425m of equity and US$400m of convertible bonds.<br>\nThe current stage, the US$3.0bn &#x2018;Senior Debt Event&#x2019; (&#x2018;Stage 2b&#x2019;), involves: raising at least US$500m of Initial Bonds or other acceptable financing; and entering into a US$2.5bn Revolving Credit Facility (RCF). Each of the senior debt components would be conditional (amongst other things) on the other being available. The Event is also a condition for the released of escrowed Stage 2a convertible proceeds.<br>\nWe expect the Senior Debt Event to catalyse a major re-rating of the shares, as it is in our view effectively the key to unlocking Sirius&#x2019;s vast value potential. Beyond that, while Sirius would still be some years from becoming cash generative, an investment in the company should become progressively de-risked and enjoy significant value uplift as it advances towards production, we believe.</p></blockquote>\n</div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">GBKrona</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHola\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1565086390\" data-mid=\"1451902\" data-rawmessage=\"And Liberum.\" id=\"webchat-msg-1451902\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">11:13am</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>And Liberum.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"msg blockquote has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1565086394\" data-mid=\"1451903\" data-rawmessage=\"Sirius has suspended bond issue until market conditions stabilise, we think it will likely e-launch at the beginning of September.

On<br>\nthe call today it said it expects a &#xA3;200-300m benefit from &#x201C;normal wkg cap&#x201D;<br>\nand a &#xA3;300-400m inflow from prepayments on long-term service<br>\nagreements in 2020. This means &#xA3;500-700m of the 2020 FCF is from wkg<br>\ncap items. Many sell-side forecasts have far lower wkg cap inflows than<br>\nthis. This reaffirms our view that the RR compiled consensus EBITA for<br>\n2020 (and probably 2021) is c10% too high. In short, in 2020 there will be<br>\nmore cash from wkg cap than from profit.<br>\n&#xF0B7; Reducing market share expectation on Boeing 787: On the call RR said it<br>\nexpects to maintain a market share of 35% on the Trent 1000.

Investment thesis: Genel is one of a handful of stocks we forecast will generate its market cap in FCF within about four years at $70/bbl oil and is the currently the largest FCF yielder in our Kurdistan coverage. Growth is likely to come from assets held in partnership with Chevron, Sarta and Qara Dagh, however, this is dependent on appraisal &amp; exploration success. It is for this reason that we prefer the growth story of peer Gulf Keystone</p></blockquote>\n</div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">Excel Developer</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbut the buy everything rally has ended, expect bonds and equities to be negatively correlated (i.e business as usual)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><time class=\"marketslive-timestamp o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2019-08-06T11:11:32.000Z\" title=\"Tue Aug 06 2019 11:11:32 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Tue Aug 06 2019 11:11:32 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t12:11 pm\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time><div class=\"msg blockquote has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1565089907\" data-mid=\"1451996\" data-rawmessage=\"&#x2022; H1 numbers in line: Production 37.4 kb/d (thin consensus: 37.8 kb/d), revenue $194M ($184M), FCF $76M ($82M), capex $72M ($60M)\n&#x2022; Production guidance maintained, FCF at top end of range: FY19 production &quot;close to Q4 2018 levels&quot;, 36.9 kb/d, FCF guided to top end of prior $150-170M guidance\n&#x2022; Interim dividend declared: $0.05/shr as expected\n&#x2022; Little material news on operations: Well location for Qara Dagh exploration chosen (2020 well result); Sarta production still flagged for mid-2020\" id=\"webchat-msg-1451996\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">12:11pm</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><blockquote><p>&#x2022; H1 numbers in line: Production 37.4 kb/d (thin consensus: 37.8 kb/d), revenue $194M ($184M), FCF $76M ($82M), capex $72M ($60M)<br>\n&#x2022; Production guidance maintained, FCF at top end of range: FY19 production &quot;close to Q4 2018 levels&quot;, 36.9 kb/d, FCF guided to top end of prior $150-170M guidance<br>\n&#x2022; Interim dividend declared: $0.05/shr as expected<br>\n&#x2022; Little material news on operations: Well location for Qara Dagh exploration chosen (2020 well result); Sarta production still flagged for mid-2020</p></blockquote>\n</div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">cheeckychappy</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t@BE - how about the London property market rout?
