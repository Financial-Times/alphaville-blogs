This was the first warehouse that uses robotics,<br>\nthe technology that it is licencing to its new clients around the<br>\nworld. Given the damage has been worse than first reported,<br>\nincluding that &#x201C;during the night part of the roof collapsed and<br>\nthere has been substantial damage to the majority of the building<br>\nand its contents&#x201D;, this is likely to have a substantial impact on its<br>\nOcado.com customer experience and, whilst it is covered by<br>\ninsurance, could do lasting damage over at least the next 12<br>\nmonths, including a &#x201C;reduction in sales growth until we can<br>\nincrease capacity elsewhere.&#x201D; For the time being, we downgrade<br>\nto a Hold, target price 1,000p, until we get a better idea of the<br>\noutcome.

Loss of the iPhone order pushed that down c.11% and we estimate lower demand and de-stocking in autos contributed another -6% to the decline which implies the rest of the business contributed c.5-6% to lower volumes. Some of that is was likely from non-iPhone consumer electronics and we believe the company sold trial volumes this time last year for a new project which probably didn&#x2019;t recur. Revenue was -19% at &#xA3;64.1mn but, importantly, ASP was +4% from &#xA3;74.9/kg last year to &#xA3;78.0/kg even with currencies turning negative. Having spoken to the company it sounds like this was a combination of lower VAR volume, which includes some of the auto demand and generally comes at a lower price point, and positive local currency revenue growth in Medical. The company advised against extrapolating that ASP gain over the next three quarters and believes a flat or slightly higher ASP in FY19 is more likely; consensus has a slight decline so that&#x2019;s an upside surprise. There&#x2019;s no official Q1 consensus but we believe most were expecting something around 850t so this is slightly below.</p></blockquote>\n</div></div><time class=\"marketslive-timestamp o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2019-02-06T11:34:52.000Z\" title=\"Wed Feb 06 2019 11:34:52 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Wed Feb 06 2019 11:34:52 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t11:34 am\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time><div class=\"msg blockquote has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1549452907\" data-mid=\"1435853\" data-rawmessage=\"That said, Victrex&#x2019;s 2019 P/E of 18.6x is at the top end of its historic trading range which we think investors will increasingly question with both volume and revenue falling double-digits and that&#x2019;s the crux of our UW thesis.\" id=\"webchat-msg-1435853\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">11:35am</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><blockquote><p>That said, Victrex&#x2019;s 2019 P/E of 18.6x is at the top end of its historic trading range which we think investors will increasingly question with both volume and revenue falling double-digits and that&#x2019;s the crux of our UW thesis.</p></blockquote>\n</div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">FJ</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tElectric milk floats are the future...\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">Lemmy</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSoundbuy: maybe Ocado can launch a new &quot;smoked&quot; range?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1549452961\" data-mid=\"1435854\" data-rawmessage=\"And Numis.\" id=\"webchat-msg-1435854\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">11:36am</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>And Numis.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"msg blockquote has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1549452975\" data-mid=\"1435855\" data-rawmessage=\"Against tough comparatives the weak start to the 2019 fiscal year indicated by today&apos;s AGM and Q1 Interim Management Statement includes volumes and sales declines of 22% and 18%, respectively, in the first quarter of the year, as weakness in the Automotive and Value Added Reseller sectors contributed to a 13% decline in core volumes in Q1 2019.
