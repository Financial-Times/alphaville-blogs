An announcement on Monday by Chinalco that it<br>\nplans to cut its Liancheng 550ktpa smelter caused barely a ripple, with those who bothered to<br>\nmention it unconvinced that the cut would actually take place. We take the view that it is likely to<br>\nhave been announced in order to put pressure on the local authorities to obtain a power price cut<br>\nfor next year. With a lack of cuts elsewhere, and in fact a recent rollback at Hawesville where two<br>\npotlines are now to be kept open, the metal was thus the most bearishly viewed, with a majority<br>\npicking this at our seminar as the favourite short.</p></blockquote>\n</div></div>\n\n<time class=\"marketslive-timestamp o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2015-10-19T10:20:58.000Z\" title=\"Mon Oct 19 2015 10:20:58 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Mon Oct 19 2015 10:20:58 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t11:20 am\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time><div class=\"msg blockquote has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1445250073\" data-mid=\"1295122\" data-rawmessage=\"Lead and tin: The smaller metals were less discussed, though some love for lead was expressed\nby a couple of parties on the back of the Glencore cuts, while tin was noted for its stickiness\naround $15,000/t but was hardly the talk of the town (as usual).
