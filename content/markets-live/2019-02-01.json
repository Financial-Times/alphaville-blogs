AT1 coupon cost) vs 0.5% in 2018. The new disclosure is that c2.5% of the improvement is driven by existing identified measures (balance sheet optimization, cost reduction, etc) vs greater than 1% on a more constructive market environment and market share gains. Consensus (and Citi) is for c3%, so appears sceptical on the latter. The new cost target of c&#x20AC;21.8bn for 2019 compares favourably to the old target and consensus of c&#x20AC;22bn.

But in the desperation to avoid queues smaller &apos;entrepreneurs&apos; will escape. So there will be an &apos;arb&apos;&apos; between European produce that has had tariffs and that which has not.
