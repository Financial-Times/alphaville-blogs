As drinks prices did not increase, we believe the margin improvement was due to higher food prices and slightly easier cost pressures.  &#xF0B7;Drinks pricing. According to CGA, Wetherspoon&#x2019;s average beer price is &#xA3;2.94 (unchanged), whereas the industry average increased by 3.3% to &#xA3;3.92 over the year to June 2019.

The emphasis remains on maintenance capex, tail-end disposals and freehold reversions, benefiting LFL sales and margins. The company intends to open 10-15 pubs in 2020E. &#xF0B7;IFRS 16 will apply to 2020E&#x2019;s results. The company estimates that it will affect 2020E as follows: EBITDA should increase by c&#xA3;58m and operating profit by c&#xA3;8m. The interest charge should increase by c&#xA3;22m and profit before tax should decrease by c&#xA3;14m. On the balance sheet, a net lease liability of c&#xA3;617m and total assets of c&#xA3;618m should be recognised. There will be no impact on cash flows except in relation to tax payments. &#xF0B7;Net debt rose by just &#xA3;10m in 2019 even though &#xA3;77m was spent on freehold reversions and &#xA3;5m was spent on share buy backs.</p></blockquote>\n</div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">Big dog Denzel</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTim Martin looks like he&apos;s slowly morphing into a Yes and/or Rush tribute band bassist.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><div class=\"msg blockquote has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1568370353\" data-mid=\"1453749\" data-rawmessage=\"The reason we do not have a negative recommendation is that there is capacity for the company to raise drink prices, and the profit sensitivity to this is large, as we saw in 2017, when earnings rose by 43%.

Both on Monday and Tuesday, we experienced factor performances unseen in more than ten years, across all major regions. What is astonishing is that at the same time global equity markets barely moved. So, this was not the typical Value rally of a bull market, but a strong reversal of the Quality vs Value trade.\n\n\nWhat was the context: We have been arguing, for some time now, that Value stocks are extremely cheap and Quality stocks or bond proxies were expensive. We had a polarised equity market created by collapsing bond yields, which has been a feature of the market since QE came along but went to extreme levels over the summer. What created this problem was fear of an impending slowdown and a search for perceived safety. Any asset with volatility and drawdown was to be avoided. Value being both volatile and cyclical and having underperformed for almost three years was shunned. Bond yields plummeted further this summer, which has led Value to underperform further and, more importantly, to a rally in all things &#x201C;bond-like&#x201D;. A strong reversal was always a risk.\n\n\nWhat was the trigger: Over the past week bond yields have broken their downtrend and bounced back strongly. The force of the moves highlights how polarised the markets are. Essentially, the Quality versus Value trade gave back months of gains in two days. Many investors are stressing out as most of the things they own have lost money quite quickly. Conversely the one thing they don&apos;t own Value stocks and cyclical risk more generally, has rallied.\n\n\nWhat are the lessons: Bond risk in equity markets should not be overlooked. Our primary argument for Value was not dependent on accelerating GDP growth or an economic regime change, but largely about the need to diversify interest rate risk, a point we made a year ago when rates were rising. The same applies today. There is too much bond price momentum priced into asset prices and to hedge this risk you need to buy cyclical upside, that might be bank stocks, autos, the Nikkei 225 or Value, which by definition is a portfolio of the world&apos;s problems.\n\n\nWhat is next: Value stocks are still attractively valued, but they will most likely require positive economic news flow to extend their rally. Despite some relief from macro fears and trade talks, the economic environment has not changed. Rates and credit spread moves following the upcoming central bank meetings will be key to watch. Value has already given back some of its gains in Europe following the ECB meeting today. Irrespective, investors need to diversify their bond and bond proxy risk.

It has, besides, enjoyed a sharp positive momentum since the announcement of the acquisition of Refinitiv.\nHence, this offer is not that surprising and there is a good probability the US market venues, ICE and CME, could soon bid on the company as well.\nHowever, the HKSE bid is by far the least attractive. The offer might have been interesting for the LSEG&#x2019;s shareholders (and the board and management might have supported the deal) if it was fully-cash financed (40% versus price before the LSEG/Ref deal was announced). But only 1/4tr of the acquisition would be financed in cash with the rest paid in HKSE shares.\nThis financing proposal with the condition to drop the Refinitiv deal would leave far too many uncertainties for LSEG&#x2019;s shareholders.
