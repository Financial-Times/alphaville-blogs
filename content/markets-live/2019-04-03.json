For months now, the IHS Markit/CIPS PMIs have been flagging how the uncertainty around what form Brexit would take was affecting the UK economy. With the level of political uncertainty, reaching new heights last month the impact of that on the economy became increasingly clear.\n\nThe composite PMI fell to the no-change 50 mark from 51.5 last month. However, that masks a more widespread weakness in the survey with activity in both the services and construction sectors contracting and only Brexit related stockpiling the manufacturing sector keeping the composite above 50.\n\nThe services PMI fell to 48.9, to leave it below 50 for the first time since July 2016. Excluding that immediate post-referendum reading, you have to go back to Dec 2012 to find the last sub-50 reading. Markit provide an effective summary in the accompanying press release: &#x201C;There were widespread reports that domestic political uncertainty had constrained demand in March, with clients hoping for clarity about Brexit outcomes before committing to new projects.&#x201D;\n\nThe manufacturing PMI rose to 55.1 from 52.0 previously as the pace of stockpiling ahead of what was expected to be Brexit day at the end of March accelerated. If firms were working to an end of March deadline than presumably this should be the peak of this effect in the sector. However, if this is just firms bringing production forward that will have to be &apos;paid back&apos; at some point. For us, combination of the run-down of inventories and weaker global trade mean that the prospects for the sector in coming months are tilted heavily to the downside.\n\nThe construction PMI remained below 50 for a second consecutive month. Again, the sector splits between residential work (i.e. houses and apartments) and civil engineering and commercial work. Commercial work is again the worst performing of the three sectors with the accompanying press release from Markit report that &#x201C;Brexit uncertainty and concerns about the domestic economic outlook had led to risk aversion among clients&#x201D;.\n\nClearly, Bexit is affecting activity, however, possibly by not as much as the PMIs are pointing to. The March PMIs have left our PMI-based GDP model pointing to Q1 growth of -0.1% q/q. The January GDP release, however, showed the economy growing by 0.5% m/m suggesting that the PMIs are overstating the extent of the Q1 slowdown and we still expect the economy to register an expansion of 0.2% q/q in Q1.\" id=\"webchat-msg-1440891\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">11:13am</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><blockquote><p>The UK&#x2019;s EU exit day was meant to be at the end of March. For months now, the IHS Markit/CIPS PMIs have been flagging how the uncertainty around what form Brexit would take was affecting the UK economy. With the level of political uncertainty, reaching new heights last month the impact of that on the economy became increasingly clear.</p>\n<p>The composite PMI fell to the no-change 50 mark from 51.5 last month. However, that masks a more widespread weakness in the survey with activity in both the services and construction sectors contracting and only Brexit related stockpiling the manufacturing sector keeping the composite above 50.</p>\n<p>The services PMI fell to 48.9, to leave it below 50 for the first time since July 2016. Excluding that immediate post-referendum reading, you have to go back to Dec 2012 to find the last sub-50 reading. Markit provide an effective summary in the accompanying press release: &#x201C;There were widespread reports that domestic political uncertainty had constrained demand in March, with clients hoping for clarity about Brexit outcomes before committing to new projects.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The manufacturing PMI rose to 55.1 from 52.0 previously as the pace of stockpiling ahead of what was expected to be Brexit day at the end of March accelerated. If firms were working to an end of March deadline than presumably this should be the peak of this effect in the sector. However, if this is just firms bringing production forward that will have to be &apos;paid back&apos; at some point. For us, combination of the run-down of inventories and weaker global trade mean that the prospects for the sector in coming months are tilted heavily to the downside.</p>\n<p>The construction PMI remained below 50 for a second consecutive month. Again, the sector splits between residential work (i.e. houses and apartments) and civil engineering and commercial work. Commercial work is again the worst performing of the three sectors with the accompanying press release from Markit report that &#x201C;Brexit uncertainty and concerns about the domestic economic outlook had led to risk aversion among clients&#x201D;.</p>\n<p>Clearly, Bexit is affecting activity, however, possibly by not as much as the PMIs are pointing to. The March PMIs have left our PMI-based GDP model pointing to Q1 growth of -0.1% q/q. The January GDP release, however, showed the economy growing by 0.5% m/m suggesting that the PMIs are overstating the extent of the Q1 slowdown and we still expect the economy to register an expansion of 0.2% q/q in Q1.</p></blockquote>\n</div></div><time class=\"marketslive-timestamp o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2019-04-03T10:14:48.000Z\" title=\"Wed Apr 03 2019 10:14:48 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Wed Apr 03 2019 10:14:48 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t11:14 am\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1554286503\" data-mid=\"1440892\" data-rawmessage=\"But let&apos;s not get bogged down in that.\" id=\"webchat-msg-1440892\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">11:15am</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>But let&apos;s not get bogged down in that.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"msg separator has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1554286507\" data-mid=\"1440893\" data-rawmessage=\"11:14AM\" id=\"webchat-msg-1440893\">\n\t<div class=\"messagebody\"><time class=\"o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2019-04-03T10:15:07.000Z\" title=\"Wed Apr 03 2019 10:15:07 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Wed Apr 03 2019 10:15:07 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tundefined\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time></div></div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1554286529\" data-mid=\"1440894\" data-rawmessage=\".... though there&apos;s nearly nothing to get bogged down in for corporate either.\" id=\"webchat-msg-1440894\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">11:15am</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>.... though there&apos;s nearly nothing to get bogged down in for corporate either.</p>\n</div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">1st Lt.

It implies 17x PER FY2020/21E (when minimal rail EBIT is left<br>\nin our projections) vs. 13.3x ex Rail PER (21-year median).<br>\n&#x2022; As the outlook stabilises we see scope for the achieved PER multiple to<br>\nexpand as: (1) Low bond yields imply a higher (than long-term average<br>\nPER) value for cash generative UK bus. (2) The business profit mix<br>\npotentially moves away from low multiple UK Rail (even though the<br>\ncompany itself sees more value in Rail than we find from investors.) (3) If<br>\naccretive UK Bus M&amp;A is made (buying under managed bus operations).</p></blockquote>\n</div></div><div class=\"msg separator has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1554289022\" data-mid=\"1440972\" data-rawmessage=\"11:56AM\" id=\"webchat-msg-1440972\">\n\t<div class=\"messagebody\"><time class=\"o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2019-04-03T10:57:02.000Z\" title=\"Wed Apr 03 2019 10:57:02 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Wed Apr 03 2019 10:57:02 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tundefined\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time></div></div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1554289106\" data-mid=\"1440973\" data-rawmessage=\"Oh, note just through from Ian Gordon at Investec.\" id=\"webchat-msg-1440973\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">11:58am</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>Oh, note just through from Ian Gordon at Investec.</p>\n</div></div><time class=\"marketslive-timestamp o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2019-04-03T10:58:21.000Z\" title=\"Wed Apr 03 2019 10:58:21 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Wed Apr 03 2019 10:58:21 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t11:58 am\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1554289116\" data-mid=\"1440974\" data-rawmessage=\"Who&apos;s calling the top in StanChart.\" id=\"webchat-msg-1440974\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">11:58am</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>Who&apos;s calling the top in StanChart.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"msg blockquote has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1554289130\" data-mid=\"1440975\" data-rawmessage=\"STAN shares are up 13% in 6 days, which represents a fresh 7-month high.\nGiven our belief that a &#x201C;final&#x201D; settlement with the US authorities may be\nimminent, this move is, we think, justified.
