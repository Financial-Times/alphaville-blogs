For much of the past few months, Tesla&#x2019;s CEO has<br>\nmade statements directly engaging investors and at many times making<br>\nsupportive statements to the share price. Investors might reasonably ask<br>\nwhy Tesla management would want the stock price to reflect all the<br>\npremium of an LBO up-front. It is hard to understand the potential reason<br>\nfor such a negotiating strategy.</p></blockquote>\n</div></div><time class=\"marketslive-timestamp o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2018-08-08T10:21:41.000Z\" title=\"Wed Aug 08 2018 10:21:41 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Wed Aug 08 2018 10:21:41 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t11:21 am\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time><div class=\"msg blockquote has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1533723716\" data-mid=\"1424580\" data-rawmessage=\"At first blush, the LBO math required to support $420 is extremely\naggressive, in our view.
