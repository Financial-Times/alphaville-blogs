We have previously highlighted our view that Imperial has the weakest portfolio in Tobacco, reporting an average LFL of 1% since 2011, significantly lower than its global tobacco peers who have delivered a LFL of 4% in the same period. Imperial continues to see growth across the nicotine market however it is clear the current portfolio mix is holding back performance vs. competitors who are more advanced in Vape, Heat not Burn and Smokeless exposure. In our note Feeling Blu we step through our view that Imperial needs to make material further investment in NGPs to drive revenues and to insulate itself from a rapid shift towards reduced risk products in its top 10 markets (greater than 70% of EBIT).</p></blockquote>\n</div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">Blank canvas</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI have to admire BE&apos;s &quot;Cave Canem&quot; coverage of Pearson\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">Mouselet</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThat paperbacks cost $2 to print means that ebooks should cost $2 less than paperbacks, which is about right\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">marktime</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSales of RizLa+ must be all time high, the untended kids here buy a new pack every time they head up behind the scout hut and then toss it\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">Tom Dalgleish</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t@Mouse, do you have a sand mine\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">cheeckychappy</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t@BE - also heard any grift around Coface in France at all recently?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">npf1</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnything on Pru.
