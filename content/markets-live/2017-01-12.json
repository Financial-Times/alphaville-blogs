We remain of the view that Mr Rowe&#x2019;s strategy is likely to end up being no more than a &#x2018;steady the ship&#x2019; strategy, with little medium-term visibility over profits or cash generation. M&amp;S is playing catch up from a difficult mid-market clothing position in a market we expect to slow in 2017. Given the low probability of cash returns over the medium term, the change in M&amp;S&#x2019; future growth prospects, limited forecast visibility and negative TSR dynamics, we see further downside potential. Valuation not cheap enough for the risk.</p></blockquote>\n</div></div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1484220106\" data-mid=\"1360119\" data-rawmessage=\"Tony Shiret&apos;s a reluctant buyer\" id=\"webchat-msg-1360119\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">PM</span><span class=\"timestamp\">11:21am</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>Tony Shiret&apos;s a reluctant buyer</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1484220110\" data-mid=\"1360120\" data-rawmessage=\"Haitong\" id=\"webchat-msg-1360120\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">PM</span><span class=\"timestamp\">11:21am</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>Haitong</p>\n</div></div><time class=\"marketslive-timestamp o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2017-01-12T11:21:49.000Z\" title=\"Thu Jan 12 2017 11:21:49 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Thu Jan 12 2017 11:21:49 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t11:21 am\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time><div class=\"msg blockquote has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1484220124\" data-mid=\"1360121\" data-rawmessage=\"Is there anything in these results or the accompanying commentary that provides insight into the new trading strategy and its resonance and sustainability with consumers?

Despite this, EBITDA of &#xA3;162m was 3% short of consensus estimates with the 17.5% margin well below the 18.0% management had guided to. This was driven entirely by issues at Spire St Anthony&apos;s, a hospital it acquired in 2014 and has significantly expanded since. The hospital generated an EBITDA loss of &#xA3;1.5m versus a profit of &#xA3;5m the previous year. Excluding this effect, Spire would have delivered revenue growth of 4.9% and an EBITDA margin of 18.3%, well ahead of guidance. \n\nWhile management provided little detail on the issues at St Anthony&apos;s we believe the site expansion (building of new operating theatres) combined with a restructuring of operations since acquisition are likely to have led to cost issues. We expect these to persist into H1 2017 although the company should be able to turn this around by the second half.\n\n2017 guidance to drive near-term downgrades\n\nWhile the underlying business generated EBITDA growth of 5.5% in 2016 despite some headwinds and there are a number of tailwinds in 2017, we believe the issues at St Anthony&apos;s will weigh on earnings next year. This has been reflected in guidance with management expecting EBITDA to be flat for 2017 before returning to mid-to-high single digit growth from 2018. Consensus currently expects 2017 EBITDA of &#xA3;175m implying a downgrade of 6-7% at the EBITDA level, although net income forecasts are likely to fall by a little more. Given the issues are cost and not revenue driven, Spire may be able to make a lot of this up in 2018 if it can turn St Anthony&apos;s around and therefore the longer-term downgrades may be less substantial.\n\nNHS tariff largely as expected, provides good visibility\n\nThe NHS tariff for 2017/18 (effective April 2017-March 2018) and 2018/19 (effective April 2018-March 2019) was finalised on December 22 last year. Spire management has analysed this two year tariff and believes that assuming procedure mix remains constant, its NHS price will fall by an average of 3.9% in 2017/18 and be flat in 2018/19. If the tariff is &quot;calendarised&quot; for Spire&apos;s fiscal year then we estimate an impact of -2.6% for 2017 and -1.0% for 2019. This is more or less as we had expected (albeit with different phasing). We think this is quite a good result for Spire and more importantly gives it price visibility for two years, something it has never had before. Importantly, with two year&apos;s visibility, Spire will be better able to shift its procedure mix toward higher value services and therefore the ultimate price impact may be meaningfully better than expected.\n\nDisappointing update with one difficult hospital overshadowing a strong performance across the rest of the portfolio\n\nToday&apos;s update will dent investor confidence in management as following a challenging 2015, Spire had begun to demonstrate that the business was back on-track to deliver growth. That said, with the underlying business performing ahead of expectations, we believe there is still the potential for Spire to deliver strong growth in the mid-term once it can resolve the issues at St Anthony&apos;s. We would expect the shares to come under pressure today.\" id=\"webchat-msg-1360169\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-2\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">11:39am</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><blockquote><p>2016 EBITDA miss driven by St Anthony&apos;s, underlying business performing well</p>\n<p>Spire delivered revenues of &#xA3;925m which was up 4.5% reported and at the top end of its 3-5% guidance range.

Given the issues are cost and not revenue driven, Spire may be able to make a lot of this up in 2018 if it can turn St Anthony&apos;s around and therefore the longer-term downgrades may be less substantial.</p>\n<p>NHS tariff largely as expected, provides good visibility</p>\n<p>The NHS tariff for 2017/18 (effective April 2017-March 2018) and 2018/19 (effective April 2018-March 2019) was finalised on December 22 last year. Spire management has analysed this two year tariff and believes that assuming procedure mix remains constant, its NHS price will fall by an average of 3.9% in 2017/18 and be flat in 2018/19. If the tariff is &quot;calendarised&quot; for Spire&apos;s fiscal year then we estimate an impact of -2.6% for 2017 and -1.0% for 2019. This is more or less as we had expected (albeit with different phasing). We think this is quite a good result for Spire and more importantly gives it price visibility for two years, something it has never had before. Importantly, with two year&apos;s visibility, Spire will be better able to shift its procedure mix toward higher value services and therefore the ultimate price impact may be meaningfully better than expected.</p>\n<p>Disappointing update with one difficult hospital overshadowing a strong performance across the rest of the portfolio</p>\n<p>Today&apos;s update will dent investor confidence in management as following a challenging 2015, Spire had begun to demonstrate that the business was back on-track to deliver growth. That said, with the underlying business performing ahead of expectations, we believe there is still the potential for Spire to deliver strong growth in the mid-term once it can resolve the issues at St Anthony&apos;s. We would expect the shares to come under pressure today.</p></blockquote>\n</div></div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1484221241\" data-mid=\"1360170\" data-rawmessage=\"Haven&apos;t heard the Mediclinic - Spire rumour for a few months, incidentally.\" id=\"webchat-msg-1360170\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-2\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">11:40am</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>Haven&apos;t heard the Mediclinic - Spire rumour for a few months, incidentally.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1484221271\" data-mid=\"1360171\" data-rawmessage=\"Last time it came up, which was September, the {feltcollaredsource} were very dismissive of the idea.\" id=\"webchat-msg-1360171\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-2\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">11:41am</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>Last time it came up, which was September, the <span class=\"webchat-emoticon webchat-emoticon--feltcollaredsource\" data-code=\"feltcollaredsource\">Feltcollaredsource</span> were very dismissive of the idea.</p>\n</div></div><time class=\"marketslive-timestamp o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2017-01-12T11:41:31.000Z\" title=\"Thu Jan 12 2017 11:41:31 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Thu Jan 12 2017 11:41:31 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t11:41 am\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1484221306\" data-mid=\"1360172\" data-rawmessage=\"Said it was just JP Morgan causing trouble, and that Mediclinic was in no state to do anything after a profit warning.\" id=\"webchat-msg-1360172\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-2\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">11:41am</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>Said it was just JP Morgan causing trouble, and that Mediclinic was in no state to do anything after a profit warning.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1484221320\" data-mid=\"1360173\" data-rawmessage=\"Fair enough\" id=\"webchat-msg-1360173\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">PM</span><span class=\"timestamp\">11:42am</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>Fair enough</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1484221392\" data-mid=\"1360174\" data-rawmessage=\"Yup.

However, the stock has performed well with the stock returning 30% since its recent lows. The stock still trades at a material discount to its peer group with continued concerns about the Asia Gateway exposure. We estimate that Asia Gateway is c. 20% of earnings. If we were to exclude the Asia Gateway business the stock would trade at 12.7x 2017E earnings, still a material discount considering our forecast of double-digit growth.\n\nDetails of trading update\n\nPaysafe announced its trading update for full year 2016. Revenues should exceed $1bn (guidance $970-990m, consensus $988m) and EBITDA c$300m (guidance 287-293m, cons 292m).
