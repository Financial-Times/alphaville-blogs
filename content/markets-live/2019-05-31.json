I think management has so far always executed theirs plans perfectly. I believe they managed to carve a place for themselves in the highly profitable IVF business.  re-an insider having part of his stock on pledge, this is extremely common in the region, the guy is a billionaire, he has pledged a large portion of his stocks with a local bank but that wouldn&apos;t mean that he wont be able to meet any margin requirements, hence I struggle to see this as a worrying factor.

Based\non this 03/19A valuation, the value of Capco&#x2019;s interests in Earls Court has\nfallen to &#xA3;412m, representing a l-f-l decrease of -10.5% versus 12/18A (&#xA3;461m). To put this in context this value decline is roughly in line with the valuation writedown we had for the 19FY, and on a standalone basis (ie. excluding Covent Garden which represents c.80% of the portfolio) the pro forma 12/18A NAV is reduced by a further 1.8% (c.6p) to 320p, (Kempen 19H1 est. 321p). The reason for the valuation decline is due to a number of adjustments to component parts of the valuation, including an increased developers margin (now greater than 24%?), as well as further reductions in the outlook for gross development value.\nCapco remains in a tricky situation in our view as it cannot kick start ECPL plans without the backing of third party capital, which is unlikely to step in until we get more clarity over Brexit. At the same time the local borough council continues to publicly denounce the scheme for the lack of activity there while London is in need of more homes, and threatens a CPO (which it currently doesn&#x2019;t have the legal framework to execute).

Based<br>\non this 03/19A valuation, the value of Capco&#x2019;s interests in Earls Court has<br>\nfallen to &#xA3;412m, representing a l-f-l decrease of -10.5% versus 12/18A (&#xA3;461m). To put this in context this value decline is roughly in line with the valuation writedown we had for the 19FY, and on a standalone basis (ie. excluding Covent Garden which represents c.80% of the portfolio) the pro forma 12/18A NAV is reduced by a further 1.8% (c.6p) to 320p, (Kempen 19H1 est. 321p). The reason for the valuation decline is due to a number of adjustments to component parts of the valuation, including an increased developers margin (now greater than 24%?), as well as further reductions in the outlook for gross development value.<br>\nCapco remains in a tricky situation in our view as it cannot kick start ECPL plans without the backing of third party capital, which is unlikely to step in until we get more clarity over Brexit.
