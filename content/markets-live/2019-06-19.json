It still expects to open +2k rooms in Germany this\nyear. It will continue to invest in growing its estate in both the UK and Germany despite\nany deterioration in conditions, arguing that any cyclical change should not impact the\nstructural opportunity.

We cut our forecasts at the prelims</p>\n<p>stage and we leave our forecasts unchanged. We assume a 3% decline in RevPar to<br>\n&#xA3;47.46 for FY20E and a 2% decline to &#xA3;46.51 for FY21E. Every one percent change in<br>\nRevPar impacts EBIT by &#xA3;12m-&#xA3;15m. We assume that lower achieved room rates, rather<br>\nthan occupancy, account for most of the decline. Whitbread is determined to keep its<br>\nhotels busy rather than protecting price, following a strategy that is similar to the airlines.<br>\nWhitbread&apos;s cost saving initiatives are helping to protect margins and profitability. At the<br>\nprelims, it set out a new target of &#xA3;220m of savings over the next three years, to be split<br>\n&#xA3;120m of opex and &#xA3;100m of capex savings. This is on top of the &#xA3;150m delivered in<br>\nthe last three years. Whitbread has a &#xA3;1.6bn cost base and expects to offset &#xA3;40m-<br>\n&#xA3;50m of the anticipated &#xA3;70m of cost headwinds in FY20. Whitbread will implement the<br>\nnew IFRS16 accounting standard at the interim stage and we will follow suit.<br>\nWhitbread has trimmed UK new room guidance to 3k-3.5k from 3k-4k; and will delay<br>\nextensions rather than new builds. It still expects to open +2k rooms in Germany this<br>\nyear. It will continue to invest in growing its estate in both the UK and Germany despite<br>\nany deterioration in conditions, arguing that any cyclical change should not impact the<br>\nstructural opportunity. To this end, it has retained &#xA3;300m to acquire the German hotels<br>\nat end February 2020 and a further &#xA3;500m for other opportunities. It is fortunate that it<br>\nhas a strong balance sheet that allows it to be so far-sighted.</p></blockquote>\n</div></div><time class=\"marketslive-timestamp o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2019-06-19T10:27:00.000Z\" title=\"Wed Jun 19 2019 10:27:00 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Wed Jun 19 2019 10:27:00 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t11:27 am\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time><div class=\"msg blockquote has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1560940035\" data-mid=\"1447857\" data-rawmessage=\"At yesterday&apos;s close, Whitbread is trading on a PE of 20.1x, and EV/EBITDA of 10.7x and\nFCF yield of 5.4% for FY20E, changing to 16.9x, 10.7x and 6.3% respectively for FY21E.\nOur 4850p target price is based on FY21E as FY20E is still a transitional year for its\ncapital structure; we use a cautious c.11.5x EBITDA to value Premier Inn and 9.0x for the\npub restaurants.

Acquisition of Thoughtonomy for up to &#xA3;80m.\n\n \n\nThe robotic process automation software and services specialist reports its interim results for FY2019 (October year-end), confirming strong revenue momentum tracking slightly ahead of full year expectations in terms of growth. Revenue grew by 82% to &#xA3;41.6m (prior H1: &#xA3;22.9m), adjusted LBITDA loss of &#xA3;34.0m on continued investment (which is 44% of the full year consensus LBITDA), with the company prioritising investment for scale and growth. As usual, operating cash outflow ran ahead of EBITDA reflecting positive working capital requirements (customers typically paying annually up front), at &#xA3;18.9m. Net cash stood at &#xA3;129.4m despite174% growth in Sales &amp; Marketing headcount since 1H18 to support growth and improve reach.\n\n \n\nSitting behind the revenue performance was significant growth in the number of software deals with new and existing customers. The total number of software deals secured during year was 911 (prior H1: 559), up by 63%, consisting of 349 customer additions (prior H1: 349), up by 57%, and 496 upsells (prior H1: 298) upsells, up by 66%. At the end of 2018, the total customer base stood at 1,337 (prior H1: 700), up by 91%.\n\n \n\nPrism has also announced the acquisition of Thoughtonomy for aggregate consideration of up to &#xA3;80m, enhances cloud capabilities and directly addresses the mid-tier market. In the remaining three months of the Group&#x2019;s financial year, it is anticipated that Thoughtonomy will increase revenues by up to &#xA3;3m and increase EBITDA losses by up to &#xA3;2m.\n\n \n\nThe Board is said to be confidence in the outlook based on the exit monthly recurring revenue, and as a result, expects the Group&#x2019;s underlying 2019 performance, excluding the acquisition of Thoughtonomy, will be in line with the expectations outlined at its trading update in November 2018 and reiterated at the full year results in January.

Acquisition of Thoughtonomy for up to &#xA3;80m.</p>\n<p>The robotic process automation software and services specialist reports its interim results for FY2019 (October year-end), confirming strong revenue momentum tracking slightly ahead of full year expectations in terms of growth. Revenue grew by 82% to &#xA3;41.6m (prior H1: &#xA3;22.9m), adjusted LBITDA loss of &#xA3;34.0m on continued investment (which is 44% of the full year consensus LBITDA), with the company prioritising investment for scale and growth. As usual, operating cash outflow ran ahead of EBITDA reflecting positive working capital requirements (customers typically paying annually up front), at &#xA3;18.9m. Net cash stood at &#xA3;129.4m despite174% growth in Sales &amp; Marketing headcount since 1H18 to support growth and improve reach.</p>\n<p>Sitting behind the revenue performance was significant growth in the number of software deals with new and existing customers. The total number of software deals secured during year was 911 (prior H1: 559), up by 63%, consisting of 349 customer additions (prior H1: 349), up by 57%, and 496 upsells (prior H1: 298) upsells, up by 66%.
