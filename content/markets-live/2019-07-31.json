Further, the company is also expecting a substantial improvement in FCF also in 2H19<br>\n(JPMe: -&#x20AC;87m) vs. 2H18 (-&#x20AC;366m) with working capital expected to be flat also in 2H. Given a high level of<br>\nbearishness on the stock, we believe these results should bring some relief to the stock today. We also note<br>\nincrementally improved disclosures by the company in 1H19 which is very welcome.</p></blockquote>\n</div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">FATDAZ</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t@bluesky  no expert but believe service corp tried to consolidate and corner the UK market so a similar story to DTY\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><div class=\"msg blockquote has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1564571291\" data-mid=\"1451540\" data-rawmessage=\"Adj EBIT in Energy &amp; Surface Technologies in 1H19 of &#x20AC;101.6m/16.7% margin was down 16% YoY reflecting the\nimpact of the previously flagged slowdown in the EV demand (EV related sales flat in 1H), almost no demand for\nenergy storage applications in Korea, the direct and indirect impact of lower cobalt prices and higher D&amp;A. 1H EBIT\nin the Catalysis division of &#x20AC;86.6m/12.1% margin was flat YoY and ~5% higher than expectations despite the weak\nauto demand environment and diesel share decline in Europe.
