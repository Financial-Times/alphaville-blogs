UBM&apos;s portfolio is industrially and geographically diverse with a US/EM bias, the market is fragmented and ripe for consolidation, there is scope for greater margin expansion than consensus assumes and the business has good cash generation with low capex/sales.</p>\n<p>&#x25A0; Catalysts &amp; Risks: The fashion vertical (17% of Events) could decelerate faster than expected, other verticals could suffer online disruption, digital natives could veer away from face-to-face events, acquisitions could disappoint and the economic cycle could be overextended. Travel and free trade issues could also arise and growth improvement may be lumpy due to phasing. Catalysts include H1 results (28 July) and further acquisitions.</p></blockquote>\n</div></div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1497610938\" data-mid=\"1381427\" data-rawmessage=\"And, as Soundbuy notes, Liberum&apos;s been talking to media buyers.\" id=\"webchat-msg-1381427\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">12:02pm</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>And, as Soundbuy notes, Liberum&apos;s been talking to media buyers.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1497611008\" data-mid=\"1381428\" data-rawmessage=\"Speaking generally, I&apos;m always fascinated by the trend that analysts who buy ITV talk to media buyers who are positive about the outlook, and analysts who sell ITV talk to media buyers who are negative about the outlook.\" id=\"webchat-msg-1381428\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">12:03pm</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>Speaking generally, I&apos;m always fascinated by the trend that analysts who buy ITV talk to media buyers who are positive about the outlook, and analysts who sell ITV talk to media buyers who are negative about the outlook.</p>\n</div></div><time class=\"marketslive-timestamp o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2017-06-16T11:03:46.000Z\" title=\"Fri Jun 16 2017 11:03:46 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Fri Jun 16 2017 11:03:46 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t12:03 pm\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1497611041\" data-mid=\"1381429\" data-rawmessage=\"Observer-expectancy effect, maybe?
