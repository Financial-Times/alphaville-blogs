We believe that Fever-Tree&apos;s leading position in the category and broad portfolio of mixers means it is well placed to capitalise on this opportunity. We have rebalanced our regional forecasts, but make no material changes to group forecasts. We think the current valuation represents an excellent entry point to the long-term growth opportunity.

In our view the key message is the announced strategic change which<br>\ninvolves: 1) focus on Personal Care and Beauty brands in geographies that can scale growth; 2) Simplification<br>\nof the Nigerian activities; 3) Disposal of non-core brands. Management expects conditions in key markets to<br>\nremain challenging, and 2019/20 to be an important transitional year.<br>\n&#xF0B7; Results are mixed across markets. Adjusted operating profit of &#xA3;76.5m was down 10.7% y/y (-9.7% on<br>\nconstant currency basis). It was negatively impacted by weak conditions in Africa (-115.9% y/y; -117.7% on<br>\nconstant currency), while Europe &amp; The Americas was down 6.1% y/y (-6.2% cc) and Asia performed strong,<br>\nup 9.7 (+13.7% cc).<br>\n&#xF0B7; Europe &amp; The Americas: Beauty was strong, especially driven by St Tropez introduction in the US.<br>\nHowever, performance for the region was offset by increased marketing spend in the UK and weaker<br>\nperformance in Food &amp; Nutrition in Greece.<br>\n&#xF0B7; Asia Pacific: Strong performance was driven by Indonesia (especially Cussons Baby) and Australia (margin<br>\nimprovement across categories), partially offset by impact of lower revenue in the Middle East.<br>\n&#xF0B7; Africa: Lower revenue in Personal and Home Care categories, and increased operating costs predominantly<br>\nrelating to previously highlighted charges associated with port access issues in Lagos.<br>\n&#xF0B7; Net debt improved to &#xA3;152.2m (JPMe &#xA3;152.9m) from &#xA3;165.7m at FY18.<br>\n&#xF0B7; Dividend of 8.28p is unchanged y/y and in line with expectations (JPMe 8.28p).<br>\n&#xF0B7; Reported PBT of &#xA3;37.0m (down 37.5% y/y from &#xA3;59.2m) was impacted by non-cash impairment of<br>\nintangible assets (five:am in Australia and Nutricima in Nigeria).<br>\n&#xF0B7; More details on the strategic change will be announced in the 2019 Annual Report and Accounts.<br>\n&#xF0B7; Outlook points out challenging conditions in key markets will likely remain.</p></blockquote>\n</div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">marktime</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOh boy cmon lets have the Boris announcement.

For us the key takeaways were as follows:<br>\nECB rate cuts (=): SAN is already passing negative rates through to its<br>\n1.institutional (corporate) clients, but only to their non-operational deposits (operational deposits remain remunerated at 0%); with regard to the possibility of charging households/retail depositors as well, management mentioned that it is too early to comment as this topic is not yet on the table.<br>\nCCyB (=): A 25bps hike in the countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB) in all the<br>\n2.European countries in which they operate at the same time would translate into an increase of 8bps to the Group&#x2019;s capital requirements.<br>\nCapital (=): SAN expects additional (negative) regulatory impacts worth<br>\n3.20-30bps of CET1 in 2H19 (2/3 TRIM-related, 1/3 from other minor impacts) to be more than offset through organic capital generation and further management actions, as guided during the bank&#x2019;s Investor Day in April; all in, management reiterated plans to (1) grow its CET1 B3FL ratio this year, so 4Q19 greater than 4Q18; and to (2) reach its 11.5% target as soon as possible.<br>\nRestructuring costs (=): Additional restructuring costs in Spain are expected to<br>\n4.be at &#x20AC;200mn (pay-back of 2.3 years) in 2020; in the UK, where the bank plans to reduce costs by c.&#x20AC;400mn, pay-back is estimated to be at c.1 year.<br>\nMargins (+): Management is optimistic about front-book-margins, which they&#x2019;ve<br>\n5.seen stabilizing over the last couple of quarters: (1) In Spain, they expect competition from domestic players to slow down on the back of lower-for-longer rates, which may help improve pricing dynamics locally; (2) in the UK, margin pressures are concentrated in the SVR book while front-book margins have been stable over the last two quarters (after compressing to 90bps from 130bps a year ago). Management mentioned they have room for manoeuvre (via lower funding costs) through the 123 account and other products.</p></blockquote>\n</div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">Sultan of swaps</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t@patience you have room to loose with such high margins, massive and aggressive sales investments in the US would be well received both within the group (stand alone) or if it was part of a deal\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">Excel Developer</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t#tories: get on with it, waffling on\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">Bluesky21</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBasically no loan growth y/y in UK with Santander ... despite lower NIM\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">Excel Developer</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t@bluesky21: where should nim be on average?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">red</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t@Patiencenot great place to be, pe 40 odd and growth slowing plus awful lt tech below 2250p with a nasty shs formation\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">Bluesky21</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t@ExcelDeveloper - depends on mix, credit cards is higher for example (but offset by higher losses).
