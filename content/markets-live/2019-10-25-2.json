Group revenue is<br>\n3% above consensus, pre-provision profits 8% ahead and clean PBT 14%<br>\nahead with a net loss due to &#xA3;1.4bn PPI costs. CT1 at 13.4% (JPMe 12.9%)<br>\nbenefitted from the removal of the Op risk floor which added 60bps while<br>\nrebasing the group&#x2019;s target to around 13.5% (from 13%) and we see DPS<br>\nof 9p on track for FY&apos;19. We highlight a decent sequential improvement in<br>\nUK revenue driven by Mortgage growth of &#xA3;2.9bn as well as strong<br>\nperformance from the CIB where PBT was &#xA3;115m or 16% ahead of<br>\nconsensus. Mgmt continue to target greater than 9% and greater than 10% ROTE for 19/20 but note that the rate and macro environment have made it more challenging,<br>\nparticularly for 2020. We think this is already reflected in consensus<br>\nROTE of 8.3%/8.4% for 19/20E and expect these results to lead to lowsingle-<br>\ndigit EPS upgrades for consensus driven by topline partly offset by<br>\nhigher seasonality in US Card provisions.
