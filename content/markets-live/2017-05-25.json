In our view, this accusation is highly unusual (and metallurgically questionable) and therefore further investigations may (in theory) provide some relief for the company although it is unclear what next steps can be taken to clarify this matter.

With the uncertainty around near-term viability of the concentrate production at Bulyanhulu and Buzwagi, we would expect Acacia will consider temporarily halting these operations to avoid a further build-up of working capital from the concentrate which it is unable to sell.
