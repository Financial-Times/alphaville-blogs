The equity placing will dilute the earnings, but Just Group is in the<br>\nsweet spot of significant bulk</p></blockquote>\n</div></div><time class=\"marketslive-timestamp o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2019-03-14T12:05:57.000Z\" title=\"Thu Mar 14 2019 12:05:57 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Thu Mar 14 2019 12:05:57 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t12:05 pm\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time><div class=\"msg separator has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1552565172\" data-mid=\"1439071\" data-rawmessage=\"12:05PM\" id=\"webchat-msg-1439071\">\n\t<div class=\"messagebody\"><time class=\"o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2019-03-14T12:06:12.000Z\" title=\"Thu Mar 14 2019 12:06:12 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Thu Mar 14 2019 12:06:12 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tundefined\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time></div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">cheeckychappy</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t@BE - Thanks for the another day of hilarity with nought much going on.
