Relative to the rest of the industry, this is the biggest cut we have seen to date across global semiconductors. We continue to like IQE&#x2019;s long-term position as a supplier of highly differentiated product into the structurally growing compound semiconductor industry, but the near-term negative impact is now clearly greater and IQE&#x2019;s visibility less. Our rating is Overweight with an 80p price target.</p></blockquote>\n</div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">FATDAZ</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tplot not ploy\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><time class=\"marketslive-timestamp o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2019-06-21T10:30:21.000Z\" title=\"Fri Jun 21 2019 10:30:21 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Fri Jun 21 2019 10:30:21 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t11:30 am\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1561113036\" data-mid=\"1448100\" data-rawmessage=\"(sorry for the double post ROTR, trying to co-ordinate out of office here.)\" id=\"webchat-msg-1448100\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-2\">JP</span><span class=\"timestamp\">11:30am</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>(sorry for the double post ROTR, trying to co-ordinate out of office here.)</p>\n</div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">Excel Developer</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t@daz: yeah, thanks.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">red</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsurely all these small insurers will be stuck together or nipped by larger ones?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">nightingale20201</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmorning all - a belated greeting\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1561113069\" data-mid=\"1448101\" data-rawmessage=\"Here&apos;s Peel Hunt, who have a Buy on the stock...\" id=\"webchat-msg-1448101\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-2\">JP</span><span class=\"timestamp\">11:31am</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>Here&apos;s Peel Hunt, who have a Buy on the stock...</p>\n</div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">Irish HF guy</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAlso, when KKR are selling caveat emptor\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><div class=\"msg blockquote has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1561113091\" data-mid=\"1448102\" data-rawmessage=\"IQE warns that trade war is beginning to bite hard\nIQE expects to report &#xA3;65-68m revenue for 1H19, which at midpoint will have been 39% of our prior FY19E revenue forecast,\nand broadly in line with the 40:60 seasonality guidance from\nMarch.
