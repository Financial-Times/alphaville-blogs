On the contrary, share buybacks at these levels could really create value (if dividend is sustainable, then VOD is clearly undervalued).</p></blockquote>\n</div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">Electric Dragon</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNice to see Erdogan suddenly discovering a heretofore unknown concern for journalists.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_arrested_journalists_in_Turkey\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">FATDAZ</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t@here re the banks here is chart of European and UK banking sectors performance over the last two years ....\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">FATDAZ</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thttps://www.investorsintelligence.com/x/charts/iichart?detail=y&amp;id=3266&amp;type=line&amp;_sendTo_=&amp;_period=2y&amp;rsi=14&amp;id2=3233&amp;_sample=&amp;_cdate=22 Oct 2018&amp;w=800&amp;h=600\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">wayneJ</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe US futures tend to swing quite wildly out of hours.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">Flaneur</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tItalian budget passes another hurdle - President signs it off....\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">ticker</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthey do yes, still, good fun to watch when some decent moves are predicted for fair value...\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1540290747\" data-mid=\"1429152\" data-rawmessage=\"This could&apos;ve all been avoided if Vodafone had sold itself to AT&amp;T and Verizon way back in 2013, in a story that was of course not true until SEC filings showed it was.\" id=\"webchat-msg-1429152\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">11:32am</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>This could&apos;ve all been avoided if Vodafone had sold itself to AT&amp;T and Verizon way back in 2013, in a story that was of course not true until SEC filings showed it was.</p>\n</div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">FATDAZ</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t@wayne j they were never very liquid with yanks asleep  and from what I read that liquidity has been reduced by events\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">Sagan&apos;s Ghost</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t@wayneJ The audio is too grizzly perhaps?
