TSS is a 50:50 JV between Antofagasta and Barrick Gold (covered by US Analyst John Bridges) which owns a 75% interest in the Reko Diq copper project in Pakistan. The claims are in relation to arbitration filed against the Islamic Republic of Pakistan to the unlawful denial of a mining lease. The claim comprises (100% basis): (i) $4.087bn in compensation by reference to the fair market value of the project at the time of the mining lease denial; and (ii) interest of $1.753bn until the date of the award. There is a further $62m for costs incurred by claimants. \n&#xF0B7; Next steps: The award is binding, but we understand there still remain legal avenues for the government to appeal the procedural process. We understand previous challenges have typically had up to 120 days to appeal (although we are unsure whether this applies to the current process). ANTO also noted in the release that they &#x201C;remain willing to discuss the potential for a negotiated settlement&#x2026;&#x201D;; given the interest is housed within TCC it is unclear whether a settlement requires the approval of both parties (i.e. ANTO and ABX) or whether either party can reach a settlement / outcome individually (either with the government or with a 3rd party).\n&#xF0B7; Valuation impact: On an attributable ANTO share and fully un-risked, the settlement is equivalent to ~&#xA3;2.30/sh, or ~40% our base case valuation. However we identify elevated risks around the settlement being received (ANTO itself does not yet include the proceeds in its financial statements).

TSS is a 50:50 JV between Antofagasta and Barrick Gold (covered by US Analyst John Bridges) which owns a 75% interest in the Reko Diq copper project in Pakistan. The claims are in relation to arbitration filed against the Islamic Republic of Pakistan to the unlawful denial of a mining lease. The claim comprises (100% basis): (i) $4.087bn in compensation by reference to the fair market value of the project at the time of the mining lease denial; and (ii) interest of $1.753bn until the date of the award. There is a further $62m for costs incurred by claimants.<br>\n&#xF0B7; Next steps: The award is binding, but we understand there still remain legal avenues for the government to appeal the procedural process. We understand previous challenges have typically had up to 120 days to appeal (although we are unsure whether this applies to the current process).
