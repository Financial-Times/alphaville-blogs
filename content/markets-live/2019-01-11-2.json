Not just the analysts in our division, but most analysts do seem to attribute the persistently high inflation to the combination of the fall in<br>\nsterling; a continual series of utility price hikes; and, most recently&#x2014;and we mention this in the Tealbook&#x2014;an increase in university fees.&quot;</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1547225313\" data-mid=\"1433990\" data-rawmessage=\"Is that from january?\" id=\"webchat-msg-1433990\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">IK</span><span class=\"timestamp\">4:48pm</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>Is that from january?</p>\n</div></div><time class=\"marketslive-timestamp o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2019-01-11T16:48:24.000Z\" title=\"Fri Jan 11 2019 16:48:24 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Fri Jan 11 2019 16:48:24 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t4:48 pm\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1547225319\" data-mid=\"1433991\" data-rawmessage=\"yep\" id=\"webchat-msg-1433991\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-2\">TH</span><span class=\"timestamp\">4:48pm</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>yep</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1547225341\" data-mid=\"1433992\" data-rawmessage=\"Colby is joining us on the RHS\" id=\"webchat-msg-1433992\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">IK</span><span class=\"timestamp\">4:49pm</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>Colby is joining us on the RHS</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1547225348\" data-mid=\"1433993\" data-rawmessage=\"Due to technical issues\" id=\"webchat-msg-1433993\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">IK</span><span class=\"timestamp\">4:49pm</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>Due to technical issues</p>\n</div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">Colby Smith (FT Alphaville)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYes, small tech snafu of my end, so I&apos;ll be posting from this side of the screen.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><time class=\"marketslive-timestamp o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2019-01-11T16:49:15.000Z\" title=\"Fri Jan 11 2019 16:49:15 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Fri Jan 11 2019 16:49:15 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t4:49 pm\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time><div class=\"msg blockquote has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1547225370\" data-mid=\"1433994\" data-rawmessage=\"MR.

Here he is in January: Most of the models we use assume no permanent societal cost to a much slower return to full employment. However, labor market scarring; permanent exits from the labor market, as discussed in several alternative scenarios over the past few Tealbooks; poor market experiences for newly educated workers; and growing problems associated with income inequality, exacerbated by periods of long-term unemployment, can affect the path of the economy in important ways not captured in many of the models we typically use in our calculations. What is the evidence that long-term potential for the economy is affected by the speed of the recovery? The Tealbook, Part B, has unemployment at the end of 2015 at 5.9 percent if we follow the constrained optimal control policy but at 7.3 percent if we follow Taylor (1993). Clearly, the optimal control approach is preferred; they both have inflation below 2 percent in 2015, while Taylor (1993) has a much higher unemployment rate for much longer. Prolonged unemployment is of course undesirable, but it seems to me that there are likely other reasons to be concerned with this very slow return to full employment, perhaps not well captured in the modeling exercise. Are there long-run costs to speed of adjustment that effect the fiscal deficit, potential growth in the economy, or our global competitiveness? How much of Japan&#x2019;s stagnation can be attributed to its acceptance of a slow recovery and obsession with the potential for inflation while continually being surprised by deflation? While we need to consider the possibility of future inflation or asset bubbles, there is little evidence of either in the current data. The possibility of these costs seems small relative to the costs of very high unemployment that will be exacerbated if we choose to remove accommodation quickly.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">Cat in a box</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIt was a short cycle this time, Tom.

Here he is in July: One of the constraints we have seen on house purchases up to now issupply constraints, both in terms of construction and in terms of existing inventories. The resultof that has been relatively strong pressure on prices. Presumably some of those bottlenecks willease. That means that prices won&#x2019;t go up as fast, but that in turn will help affordability. Weought to see more real activity in the housing sector.

Puerto Rico has highdebt burdens, it has a dependence on market financing, and there are fiscal issues and the risk ofdowngrade to noninvestment grade status. Financial stability concerns arise because roughly80 percent of muni mutual funds hold Puerto Rican debt. In fact, the recent increases in theyields would indicate that market participants have already become increasingly concerned aboutthe outlook on that debt. I think on the heels of the Detroit bankruptcy, a Puerto Rican default,or even a near default, particularly at the same time that fiscal policy is going through sometravails, as were highlighted in David&#x2019;s comments, could potentially have an impact on investorconfidence and possibly spread more broadly through municipal financial markets.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">Colby Smith (FT Alphaville)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnd back to the debt ceiling issue, here&apos;s Powell on the tail risks: In particular, the public and the markets seem to think that thisfall&#x2019;s debt ceiling and government shutdown confrontation is just more bread and circuses toentertain the populace, and that amounts really to a huge unpriced risk.

The possibility of ex post regret is real, but Isuspect it will be no less real in future meetings.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">Colby Smith (FT Alphaville)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t5 years later and Powell appears to still be thinking about this ex post regret.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">Lukest</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThis is just great, for many reasons.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><time class=\"marketslive-timestamp o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2019-01-11T17:53:21.000Z\" title=\"Fri Jan 11 2019 17:53:21 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Fri Jan 11 2019 17:53:21 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t5:53 pm\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1547229216\" data-mid=\"1434066\" data-rawmessage=\"ok I think that&apos;s where we leave it for now\" id=\"webchat-msg-1434066\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">IK</span><span class=\"timestamp\">5:53pm</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>ok I think that&apos;s where we leave it for now</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1547229238\" data-mid=\"1434067\" data-rawmessage=\"THe team may or may not be rereading the transcripts properly over the weekend and bringing you more on Monday\" id=\"webchat-msg-1434067\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">IK</span><span class=\"timestamp\">5:53pm</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>THe team may or may not be rereading the transcripts properly over the weekend and bringing you more on Monday</p>\n</div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">Colby Smith (FT Alphaville)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThanks, all!\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">Colby Smith (FT Alphaville)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFeel free to send us any other gems you find\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">Lukest</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBrilliant that they note what was actually said, rather than &quot;the balance of opinion was of the view that.... etc&quot;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1547229292\" data-mid=\"1434068\" data-rawmessage=\"thanks all\" id=\"webchat-msg-1434068\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-2\">TH</span><span class=\"timestamp\">5:54pm</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>thanks all</p>\n</div></div></div>",
