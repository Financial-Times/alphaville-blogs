We expect capex plans to be reviewed given the pressure on state budgets due to low oil prices. The Middle East airlines account for 10% and 8% of the Boeing and Airbus unfulfilled order-book. We believe that Emirates&#x2019; unfulfilled order for 48 A380s is most vulnerable, but investors should also be prepared for delays/cancelations to B777, B787 and A350 programmes. Qatar Airways, which has 18% excess capacity due to sanctions, is the launch customer for A350.</p></blockquote>\n</div></div><div class=\"msg separator has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1497435861\" data-mid=\"1381062\" data-rawmessage=\"11:24AM\" id=\"webchat-msg-1381062\">\n\t<div class=\"messagebody\"><time class=\"o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2017-06-14T10:24:21.000Z\" title=\"Wed Jun 14 2017 10:24:21 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Wed Jun 14 2017 10:24:21 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tundefined\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time></div></div><time class=\"marketslive-timestamp o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2017-06-14T10:25:08.000Z\" title=\"Wed Jun 14 2017 10:25:08 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Wed Jun 14 2017 10:25:08 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t11:25 am\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1497435923\" data-mid=\"1381063\" data-rawmessage=\"Wow, comments slow today.\" id=\"webchat-msg-1381063\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">11:25am</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>Wow, comments slow today.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1497435989\" data-mid=\"1381064\" data-rawmessage=\"And those we have are straying into areas we&apos;d rather avoid.
