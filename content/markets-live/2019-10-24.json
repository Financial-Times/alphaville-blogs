We remain Equal-weight, trading on 0.7x TNAV for a 9% ROTE 2020E. Ppop miss driven by trading and higher costs. Adjusted Ppop was 9/12% below MSe/consensus, driven by a &#xA3;120mn miss in Natwest Markets revenues, and 3% higher costs due to timing of costs savings. CET1 was 20bp lower than MSe, and RBS took &#xA3;900mn PPI provisions at the higher end of its previously disclosed range. Loan loss provisions were also slightly higher due to a re-calibration of the IFRS9 model in credit cards in particular. TNAV was 272p, 1% below consensus. NII was inline with volume growth offsetting margin pressure. Banking NIM was down 5bp qoq to 1.97%, 4bp of which was driven by lower deposit margins (i.e. lower rates), and 1bp due to mortgage margin pressure. Mortgage front book spreads are above the 80-100bp range previously provided in Q2, and has allowed overall mortgage income to be up in the quarter. The stock of mortgages was up 1.8% qoq and the total loan book was up 3.2% yoy. Consensus remains too high on Non-interest income. Two-thirds of the consensus miss in non-interest income was driven by Natwest Markets (100% in the case of MSe). This was driven by rates, which made only &#xA3;2mn revenues in the quarter. We think this is more of a one-off in nature, and hence we keep our estimates unchanged for 2020E. However we are already 4% below consensus in Non-Interest Income which we believe needs to come down. CET1 was 15.7% vs. MSe at 15.9%. RWAs were &#xA3;2bn higher driven by markets, which should be rectified in coming quarters. RBS took a &#xA3;900mn PPI charge in the quarter, at the higher end of the &#xA3;600-900mn range provided in September, which was compensated by a &#xA3;162mn provision release related to US RMBS. RBS&apos;s higher PPI charge has a negative read-across for Lloyds, we believe, and could reduce the latter&apos;s 2019E buyback expectations further.We leave our estimates broadly unchanged. Management has kept its &#xA3;300mn cost cutting target for 2019E, and we also leave our 2020E Natwest markets revenues unchanged (&#xA3;1.3bn vs. &#xA3;1.4-1.6bn guidance). The stock is inexpensive on 0.7x TNAV for a 9% ROTE 2020E, however we retain our preference for Lloyds where we see better risk reward.\" id=\"webchat-msg-1457658\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">11:21am</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><blockquote><p>We expect the trading-led Ppop miss and lower capital print to drive the stock lower; however with underlying trends in-line with MSe and cost targets maintained, we leave our below-consensus 2020E estimates unchanged. We remain Equal-weight, trading on 0.7x TNAV for a 9% ROTE 2020E. Ppop miss driven by trading and higher costs. Adjusted Ppop was 9/12% below MSe/consensus, driven by a &#xA3;120mn miss in Natwest Markets revenues, and 3% higher costs due to timing of costs savings. CET1 was 20bp lower than MSe, and RBS took &#xA3;900mn PPI provisions at the higher end of its previously disclosed range. Loan loss provisions were also slightly higher due to a re-calibration of the IFRS9 model in credit cards in particular. TNAV was 272p, 1% below consensus. NII was inline with volume growth offsetting margin pressure. Banking NIM was down 5bp qoq to 1.97%, 4bp of which was driven by lower deposit margins (i.e. lower rates), and 1bp due to mortgage margin pressure. Mortgage front book spreads are above the 80-100bp range previously provided in Q2, and has allowed overall mortgage income to be up in the quarter. The stock of mortgages was up 1.8% qoq and the total loan book was up 3.2% yoy. Consensus remains too high on Non-interest income. Two-thirds of the consensus miss in non-interest income was driven by Natwest Markets (100% in the case of MSe). This was driven by rates, which made only &#xA3;2mn revenues in the quarter. We think this is more of a one-off in nature, and hence we keep our estimates unchanged for 2020E. However we are already 4% below consensus in Non-Interest Income which we believe needs to come down. CET1 was 15.7% vs. MSe at 15.9%. RWAs were &#xA3;2bn higher driven by markets, which should be rectified in coming quarters. RBS took a &#xA3;900mn PPI charge in the quarter, at the higher end of the &#xA3;600-900mn range provided in September, which was compensated by a &#xA3;162mn provision release related to US RMBS. RBS&apos;s higher PPI charge has a negative read-across for Lloyds, we believe, and could reduce the latter&apos;s 2019E buyback expectations further.We leave our estimates broadly unchanged. Management has kept its &#xA3;300mn cost cutting target for 2019E, and we also leave our 2020E Natwest markets revenues unchanged (&#xA3;1.3bn vs. &#xA3;1.4-1.6bn guidance). The stock is inexpensive on 0.7x TNAV for a 9% ROTE 2020E, however we retain our preference for Lloyds where we see better risk reward.</p></blockquote>\n</div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">#REF!</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmaybe a better PR move would be to do a &#xA3;6.4bn buyback of government shares?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">A.
