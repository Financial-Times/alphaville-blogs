I was looking at their debt levels and they account for their &#xA3;375m convertible bond at fair value, which was &#xA3;302m at 30.6.2019 hence keeping &#xA3;73m outside of their stated debt level. Also interest rate swaps are going against them so their debt level of &#xA3;4,680m is really &#xA3;4,750m and add &#xA3;303m for derivative financial instruments and they have really &#xA3;5,053 of debt. Hence the equity value is at present &#xA3;557m and going to &#xA3;250m to &#xA3;300m if that. I think the banks / note holders will end up owning all the shopping centres if rents keep reducing which they have been forecast to for the rest of the year. Very interesting story, which reminds me of Ireland in 2007/2008 with commercial real estate debt on shopping centres.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">Excel Developer</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t@BE: weren&apos;t there results last week.
