Spire also screens worst in our universe based on our assessment of IFRS 16 impacts, which suggests its leverage could reach c.7x in 2019E.\" id=\"webchat-msg-1427452\">\n\t<span class=\"messageheader\"><span class=\"participant color-1\">BE</span><span class=\"timestamp\">12:00pm</span></span><div class=\"messagebody\"><blockquote><p>Despite  the  poor  performance  of  Spire shares (-40%  YTD  vs  FTSE  100 - 2.3%), Spire  shares  are  not  cheap  (8.6 x  EV/EBITDA  18E). We  believe further  downgrades  to  numbers are  likely and expect  the  stock  to extend  its  sector  underperformance.  We  have  been  cautious  for  some  time  on  the  NHS  business,  but  have  clearly underestimated  the  magnitude  of  this  impact  and,  going  forward, we  struggle  to see   how   margins can improve   meaningfully   from   here without a   significant acceleration   in   the   top line.   We don&#x2019;t  believe this   is   captured   in   consensus estimates. Spire also screens worst in our universe based on our assessment of IFRS 16 impacts, which suggests its leverage could reach c.7x in 2019E.</p></blockquote>\n</div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">Blank canvas</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNoonday gun.
