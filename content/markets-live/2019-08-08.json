Regarding disclosure of the loss in that case, as MW noted, Burford received Jaguar stock when it merged with Napo which appears to have been as part-settlement of the amount Napo owed Burford.  &quot;It did in fact write-down the value of that stock as it cratered. So the loss was shown in the financial statements of Burford.  See the 2017 annual report MD&amp;A and note 10 of the 2018 Burford annual report.  The value was written down to close to zero.  They may have been late in updating the ROIC and IRR figures in the presentations but that&apos;s not as damning as late recognition of the loss in their financial statements.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">tangledodyssey</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnd the SWF, bondholders and instis who took part in recent placings might be just behind?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">GoliathNationalBank</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIf only there was someone who could fund my litigation.....\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1565259780\" data-mid=\"1452169\" data-rawmessage=\"Or rather, &quot;did you not read any of the thousands of things written about fair value accounting before buying a stock you didn&apos;t understand?

By the way, just as an aside, INTU have a associate Prozone which is carried in the Intu financials at &#xA3;43m and the market value is &#xA3;13m. INTU are allowed under accounting rules ignore this as they deem the underlying value of Prozone to be more in the line with the book value of the position and not the market value, as an Accountant this is standard. You can drive a truck and trailer thru the carrying value of most intangible assets and level 3 assets and provide auditors DCF, terminal value projections and growth projections and you keep the asset at the value you wish, and you can ignore market reality.
