This could result<br>\nin house price deflation which is very damaging for housebuilders earnings, given the<br>\nsunk cost nature of land. We would note though the sector is well positioned to<br>\nweather this storm given most companies are in a net cash position (5% net<br>\ncash/equity and even including land credits gearing is only 18%) so any kind of<br>\nfinancial distress is very unlikely, in our view. Post today&apos;s fall, the stocks still trade on<br>\n1.4x P/TNAV. Dividends could provide some support but could be at risk if prices start<br>\nto deflate significantly. While we think value is emerging we believe there is more<br>\npotential downside risk to valuations before they become &quot;too good to ignore&quot;.</p></blockquote>\n</div></div>\n\n<div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1467195642\" data-mid=\"1335294\" data-rawmessage=\"http://i.imgur.com/1ZXwRiL.jpg\" id=\"webchat-msg-1335294\"><span class=\"messageheader par color-1\" title=\"11:20\">BE</span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p><img class=\"picture\" src=\"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2F1ZXwRiL.jpg?source=Alphaville\"></p>\n</div></div>\n\n<time class=\"marketslive-timestamp o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2016-06-29T10:21:00.000Z\" title=\"Wed Jun 29 2016 10:21:00 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Wed Jun 29 2016 10:21:00 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t11:21 am\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1467195675\" data-mid=\"1335295\" data-rawmessage=\"(@roddy1234: CAV /is/ the City&apos;s VIP lounge.)\" id=\"webchat-msg-1335295\"><span class=\"messageheader par color-1\" title=\"11:21\">BE</span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>(@roddy1234: CAV <em>is</em> the City&apos;s VIP lounge.)</p>\n</div></div>\n\n<div class=\"msg separator has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1467195682\" data-mid=\"1335296\" data-rawmessage=\"11:21AM\" id=\"webchat-msg-1335296\"><div class=\"messagebody\"><time class=\"o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2016-06-29T10:21:22.000Z\" title=\"Wed Jun 29 2016 10:21:22 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Wed Jun 29 2016 10:21:22 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tundefined\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time></div></div>\n\n<div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1467195744\" data-mid=\"1335297\" data-rawmessage=\"From the housebuilders to the challenger banks, two sectors that are inextricably linked.\" id=\"webchat-msg-1335297\"><span class=\"messageheader par color-1\" title=\"11:22\">BE</span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>From the housebuilders to the challenger banks, two sectors that are inextricably linked.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n<time class=\"marketslive-timestamp o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2016-06-29T10:22:52.000Z\" title=\"Wed Jun 29 2016 10:22:52 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Wed Jun 29 2016 10:22:52 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t11:22 am\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1467195787\" data-mid=\"1335298\" data-rawmessage=\"Both reliant on demand for and supply of high LTV loans to buy newbuilds off plan\" id=\"webchat-msg-1335298\"><span class=\"messageheader par color-1\" title=\"11:23\">BE</span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>Both reliant on demand for and supply of high LTV loans to buy newbuilds off plan</p>\n</div></div>\n\n<div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1467195817\" data-mid=\"1335299\" data-rawmessage=\"Quite a dramatic rally in Shawbrook.\" id=\"webchat-msg-1335299\"><span class=\"messageheader par color-1\" title=\"11:23\">BE</span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>Quite a dramatic rally in Shawbrook.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n<div class=\"msg price has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1467195824\" data-mid=\"1335300\" data-rawmessage=\"&lt;strong&gt;Shawbrook Group PLC (SHAW:LSE):&lt;/strong&gt;
