From an M&amp;A perspective we think the Plc is likely to make more acquisitions be it franchisees in the UK but could more likely in Ireland and these could be in a JV form so as to retain current management teams. These kind of deals would not necessarily change our recommendation but the price paid should also provide an indicative payback period that shareholders should expect from such investment - are these in line with what they expect the franchisees to bear? No long term targets have been given on any of the Group&#x2019;s new markets, deals or M&amp;A and we ask how it can be in shareholders&#x2019; interests to be buying back shares at current levels. Considering today&#x2019;s shock announcement highlights that all is not good internally. While the share performance has clearly gone against our SELL, we retain this.</p></blockquote>\n</div></div><div class=\"msg separator has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1528801725\" data-mid=\"1419834\" data-rawmessage=\"12:08PM\" id=\"webchat-msg-1419834\">\n\t<div class=\"messagebody\"><time class=\"o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2018-06-12T11:08:45.000Z\" title=\"Tue Jun 12 2018 11:08:45 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Tue Jun 12 2018 11:08:45 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tundefined\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time></div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">FATDAZ</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tre FDs leaving  I worked for a company that had 3 FDS in 18 months  turned out thee was a massive whole / fraud  in  its balance sheeet ....\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">Excel Developer</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t@red: and then the World Cup starts...\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">tangledodyssey</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBE, thank you.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">Pharma</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t@FATDAZ, but you are not implying any sort of connection, oh no.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">Cheeseberg</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthanks, BE\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">Soundbuy</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCheers all.............\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">Pharma</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t@Excel, wonder if I&apos;m the only one not watching the world cup this time round because it&apos;s in Russia\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"marketslive-user-comment\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"marketslive-user-comment-pseudonym\">FATDAZ</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t@Pahram  No merely offering a comment on my 30 years experience in work ng enevironment\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1528801859\" data-mid=\"1419835\" data-rawmessage=\"Will that do?
