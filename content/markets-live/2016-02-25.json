I believe that the<br>\nnext recession will bring deeply negative rates, however damaging it might be to bank profits,<br>\nand I see central banks implementing restrictions for holding cash. And as Vincent Chaigneau,<br>\nSG&#x2019;s head of bond strategy, pointed out to me a few days ago when the US 10y Note was<br>\n1.68%, If in one year that same note (then a 9y) trades at minus 0.32% (down 200bp) then<br>\nthe T-Note will have delivered a total return of 19%. Not bad indeed!</p></blockquote>\n</div></div>\n\n<div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1456398789\" data-mid=\"1315039\" data-rawmessage=\"done\" id=\"webchat-msg-1315039\"><span class=\"messageheader par color-1\" title=\"11:13\">PM</span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>done</p>\n</div></div>\n\n<div class=\"msg separator has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1456398792\" data-mid=\"1315040\" data-rawmessage=\"11:12AM\" id=\"webchat-msg-1315040\"><div class=\"messagebody\"><time class=\"o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2016-02-25T11:13:12.000Z\" title=\"Thu Feb 25 2016 11:13:12 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Thu Feb 25 2016 11:13:12 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tundefined\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time></div></div>\n\n<time class=\"marketslive-timestamp o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2016-02-25T11:13:04.000Z\" title=\"Thu Feb 25 2016 11:13:04 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Thu Feb 25 2016 11:13:04 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t11:13 am\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1456398799\" data-mid=\"1315041\" data-rawmessage=\"2% onthe Footsie\" id=\"webchat-msg-1315041\"><span class=\"messageheader par color-1\" title=\"11:13\">PM</span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>2% onthe Footsie</p>\n</div></div>\n\n<div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1456398811\" data-mid=\"1315042\" data-rawmessage=\"Could you have seen that half way through yesterday?\" id=\"webchat-msg-1315042\"><span class=\"messageheader par color-1\" title=\"11:13\">PM</span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>Could you have seen that half way through yesterday?</p>\n</div></div>\n\n<div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1456398823\" data-mid=\"1315044\" data-rawmessage=\"Nuts\" id=\"webchat-msg-1315044\"><span class=\"messageheader par color-1\" title=\"11:13\">PM</span><div class=\"messagebody\"><p>Nuts</p>\n</div></div>\n\n<time class=\"marketslive-timestamp o-date\" data-o-component=\"o-date\" data-o-date-format=\"h:mm a\" datetime=\"2016-02-25T11:13:32.000Z\" title=\"Thu Feb 25 2016 11:13:32 GMT+0000 (UTC)\" aria-label=\"Thu Feb 25 2016 11:13:32 GMT+0000 (UTC)\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t11:13 am\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time><div class=\"msg normal has-headshot\" data-timestamp=\"1456398827\" data-mid=\"1315045\" data-rawmessage=\"Oh, bloody hell.
